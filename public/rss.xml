If you’ve read my previous article on containers, you know that a container is made up of a few different things. We have a set of namespaces that isolate the process from other processes on the system. We have C groups or control groups to control resource utilization by that process. And finally, we have a container image which contains the binary that we want to run as well as any associated files where dependency is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s that last part, the container image that I want to focus on in this article. And we’re going to look at using prebuilt images, creating custom images, and also working with continuing registries. Let’s start with using a prebuilt image that someone else has created and pulling that from a public registry. A registry is simply a collection or a repository of images and a public one is one that’s made available to people over the internet. So to pull an image from a registry, whether that be a public registry or a private registry, we simply use the Docker command along with the pull sub command.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first I want to show you that I have a few images already pulled down. These are images that I have pulled down from the Docker Hub, which is a public image registry and we’re going to add to that. So I’m just going to run Docker pull, and I’ll specify the name of the image. And because I’m not specifying a particular registry here, Docker is going to default to Docker Hub, which is their public registry. If I had a private registry then I could specify the address of the private registry here, and Docker would pull it from that private registry. When it’s done, it pulls it down and when I run that image LS command again, you see that it’s here and so now I could easily run a container based on this image.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice it’s not necessary to pull down an image before you can run a container based on that image. If you try to run a container based on an image that doesn’t exist on your system, Docker will simply pull it automatically. The one problem with prebuilt images  is that we really don’t know how that image was created. It’s entirely possible that this image might contain some malicious software or other files that we don’t want or don’t need. Now in some cases, it’s reasonably easy to verify what this image contains and how it was built. Let’s see how that’s done.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[containers]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today I wanted to provide a brief introduction to some key container concepts.

First, let’s start with the seminal question, what are containers? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, containers take their name from their real life counterparts, we can leverage a container of any sort for this analogy, but the de-facto standard visualization is of course, the shipping container. When you’re shipping items to the other side of the world, containers make it easy to package goods together into a single shipment. The standard shape and size makes packing lots of containers onto a ship efficient, the walls provide isolation, preventing items from getting mixed together, they are portable, designed to be easily moved and shipped, and there’s a clear separation of concerns. One party is responsible for packing the container with the right items, and another party is responsible for making sure the container gets to its destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers in virtual life if you will, have very similar properties. Containers are essentially abstractions that provide a standardized way for you to package your application, its configuration and dependencies together into one logical object. These virtual containers are standardized in both how the contents are created, and largely, how they expose resources to your application. The packaging provides a logical separation between applications, it also provides efficiency, allowing many applications to run inside a single host. They are portable, because all dependencies are packaged together with the application, providing a consistent runtime environment regardless of the target system, whether that’s an on premises data center, the public cloud, or even your local laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a separation of concerns. Developers are able to focus on writing containerized applications, provided some guard rails and best practices are are provided, and operations teams are able to focus on running containers at scale, usually leveraging a container orchestration platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go any further however, let’s zoom in a little bit on what an application really is. To humans, applications are software programs developed to perform specific tasks, and execute on a computer. They are written in human readable language and compiled into something the computer understands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To computers, applications are binary instructions that tell the computer how to execute tasks. The tasks are represented as processes in the operating system, and all computation is primarily based on managing the utilization of three key components of a computer, the CPU, memory and I/O, or input, output. The CPU executes instructions, which is your application on data that is read into memory from the disk or network, and access to these resources is mediated by the operating system, which manages how much of each resource is provided to each process or application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we understand applications a little bit better, let’s dive back into what a container is, and explain  how that matters to  an application, and how those things fit together. Of course it’s an unfair comparison to compare virtual machines to containers, because they work together  quite commonly, but let’s go ahead and talk through  some of the distinctions here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of course, if we start off in building a virtual machine, we start off with hardware, and we have a host operating system, and then we have to install a hypervisor. The hypervisor is what allows you to divide up that single physical infrastructure into many smaller virtual machines. Within those virtual machines, you’re able install  a unique operating system, and of course this operating can system can be  any operating system you like, and inside of that operating system, applications can be installed along with their dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the container world, we start at the same place, we have to have hardware and infrastructure and an operating system, but we also now have a new component, the container runtime, and of course Docker is the most common container runtime used today. In addition to the container runtime, now we have the applications and their dependencies and libraries packaged together, and this is only possible because the container runtime manages that packaging and is able to understand  what a container actually is, and how that packaging works, and make that operate within the context of the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, to the container runtime, it doesn’t really care if it’s running on bare metal, or if it’s running on a virtual machine,  but certainly  both options are possible and quite common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But what are containers really, and how do I put my applications into those container boxes? I just wanna remind you, in my earlier definition, I did use the term logical object, and why? Because containers don’t really exist, and let’s go into that a little bit further. Containers leverage namespaces and control groups, otherwise known as cgroups, which are Linux Kernal features and they provide the functionality that we expect, the isolation, the packaging and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Namespaces allow the operating system to limit what a process can see, such as other processes,  the file system and more. We’re not gonna go into all the different types of namespaces, but certainly process isolation and file system isolation are are two of the key components. Cgroups on the other hand, limit what resources a process can do, or use, how much CPU, how much memory, and so on, and so this again, mediated by cgroups and allows  you to leverage this appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; All right, so now that we’ve got a little bit more information, we can describe containers slightly differently. A container is a process which is extracted from tarballs of your application and its dependency, it’s anchored to namespaces, which provides the necessary isolation we desire, and it’s controlled by cgroups which helps us with resource utilization management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And now that we have some of the underlying technology that makes containers possible out of the way, let’s take a look at the Dockerfile, which is the container specification. The Dockerfile provides a set of instructions for how you want your container to be built and run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And this is a bit more of the same thing, but leveraging a visual reference. The container runtime is a client server application. The Docker command line uses an API to connect to the container runtime, and the container runtime actually performs all the work. When you execute a docker build, the container runtime builds an image from the Docker file that you’ve already defined, and then that image can be stored in a container registry, so  it is accessible to other systems, and a container really is simply a runnable image, and when you perform a Docker run, it takes that image, unpacks it, the container runtime unpacks it, and executes it as a process, a process like any other process on your operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And so, in conclusion, containers don’t really exist, but of course they’re abstractions, and like most abstractions, ah they have the ability to be very good or very bad, and in this case,  container abstractions provide a lot of value, and are really a pretty amazing technology. So  even though containers don’t exist, long live containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Thank you for reading, and hopefully this provides a little bit of background  that helps you understand a little bit more about what containers are, and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[data science foundations:fundamentals]]></title><description><![CDATA[We're in the midst of a new global revolution, one that is driven by and focused on the data that surrounds us and infuses everything we do from making toast, to driving cars…]]></description><link>https://www.kojobartels.com//data-science-foundations:foundamentals/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.kojobartels.com//data-science-foundations:foundamentals/</guid><category><![CDATA[data science]]></category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re in the midst of a new global revolution, one that is driven by and focused on the data that surrounds us and infuses everything we do from making toast, to driving cars across the country, to inventing new paradigms for social interaction. And the key to all of this is data science. In this article, we&apos;ll explore some of the ways that data science allows us to ask and answer new questions that we previously didn&apos;t even dream of. To do that, we&apos;ll see how data science connects to other data-rich fields like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and prescriptive analytics. We&apos;ll map out the fundamental practices for gathering and analyzing data, formulating rules for classification and decision making, and implementing those insights. We&apos;ll touch on some of the tools that you can use in data science, but we&apos;ll focus primarily on the meaning and the promise of data in our lives. Because this discussion focuses on ideas as opposed to specific techniques, if you want to know how you can thrive in the new world of data regardless of your technical background, you can get a better understanding of how to draw on data to do the things that are important to you and to do them more effectively and more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 60&apos;s, Barbra Streisand sang, &quot;People who need people &quot;are the luckiest people in the world.&quot; And really, the need for belonging, the need to connect, and the need to be valued are all fundamental human motivations. As it happens, working in data science can actually help fulfill some of these foundational needs. By placing you in a position to one, do something wonderful for other people and two, in return to be valued for it. It goes back to something that a Harvard Business Review had to say about it back in 2012. Thomas Davenport and D.J. Patil made the extraordinary claim that data science, of all things, was the sexiest job of the 21st century. But they had good reasons for saying this. They are argued that data scientists had one, a valuable combination of rare qualities that two, put them in high demand. So here are some of the rare qualities. Data scientists are able to find order, meaning, and value in unstructured data. That&apos;s online sources, the graphs of social networks, audio, images, videos, and so on. They&apos;re able to predict outcomes like who&apos;s likely to purchase something or who poses a security threat, or who&apos;s likely to develop a disease, or respond well to a new treatment. They&apos;re able to automate processes like getting individualized recommendations while shopping, identifying friends in photographs, or giving psychological support in AI chat bots. And they&apos;re in high demand for a couple of really simple reasons. They provide hidden insight. Data science is able to show you things that you simply can&apos;t find through other means. And that hidden insight, in turn, provides significant competitive advantage to any organization that has the good foresight to employ and really make the most of data science. Give you a little bit more information about supply and demand here. Number one, there&apos;s been extraordinary growth in job ads. People are looking for data science. So for example, a January 2019 report from Indeed reported a 29% increase in job ads for data science over one year and 344% over six years. This is extraordinary growth. Next, they showed that there&apos;s growth in job searches. People actually trying to find jobs in data science. And they found only a 14% growth over one year. Now that may sound a little low, but the important thing to hear is that the demand is outstripping the availability. And any time that happens, you&apos;ve got value. And what this means, you know, again, specifically, the gap in supply and demand is it significant? LinkedIn reported a gap of over 150,000 jobs in data science. And it&apos;s even more dramatic when you show in related fields like machine learning engineer, artificial intelligence specialist, and so on. It&apos;s big. There are so many possibilities here to do something that is valued for others. And it&apos;s reflected in the salaries for data science. The average salary in data science is $107,000 a year. Which, just for comparison purposes, is over twice the national median in the U.S. of $47,000 a year. And that means that this is one of the best jobs in the U.S. Glass Door in January of 2019 published it&apos;s annual list of best jobs in America and for the fourth year in a row, data scientist is at the top of the list, based on job satisfaction, number of openings, salary. It really lets you know there is extraordinary potential here, something that you can provide of amazing value for potential employers. And you fan fulfill that great need and you can be valued for the things that you&apos;re able to contribute by embracing the methods and the benefits of data science in your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and you can see this in a lot of different places. Take, for instance, music. You take John, and Paul, and George, and Ringo, all wonderful musicians in their own rights, but put them together and you have The Beatles and you have revolutionized popular culture. Or take the fact that everybody has a circle of friends and basically everybody has the internet now, and you have created social networks and you have revolutionized the computing world. Or in 2013, Drew Conway proposed the combination of hacking skills, that&apos;s computer programming, and math and statistics, and substantive or topical domain expertise, together give you data science, a new field that has revolutionized both the technology and the business world. And I want to talk a little more about why each of those three elements in the Venn diagram of data science are so important. First one, the hacking skills or computer programming, the reason that&apos;s important is because you have such novel sources of data. You have social media and social networks, you have challenging formats like the graph data from those social networks or images or video that don&apos;t fit into the rows and columns of a spreadsheet, or you have streaming data like sensor data or live web data that comes in so fast that you can&apos;t pause it to analyze it. All of these require the creativity that comes with hacking and the ability to work freely with what you have in front of you. Now in terms of actual computer programming skills, there&apos;s a few things that are very useful in data science. The ability to work with a language like Python or R, these are programming languages that are very frequently used for data manipulation and modeling. There&apos;s C, and C++, and Java. These are general-purpose languages that are used for the back end, the foundational elements of data science, and they provide maximum speed. There&apos;s S-Q-L or SQL. That stands for structured query language. This is a language for working with relational databases to do queries and data manipulation. And then there are packages you can use in other languages like TensorFlow. This is an open-source library that&apos;s used for deep learning and it has revolutionized the way that data science is performed right now. And then there&apos;s the mathematical elements of data science. First off, there&apos;s several forms of mathematics that are particularly useful in data science. There&apos;s probability, and linear algebra, and calculus, and regression, and I&apos;ll talk about some of each of these, but they allow you to do something important. Number one, they allow you to choose the procedures. You want to judge the fit between your question, which is always the first and most important thing, the data that you have available to you, and then you choose a procedure that answers your questions based on your data. And if you understand the mathematics and how it works, you&apos;ll be able to make a much better and more informed choice. And also, you&apos;ll be able to diagnose problems. Murphy&apos;s Law applies in data science as well as everywhere else that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, and you need to know what to do when the procedures that you&apos;ve chosen fail or they give sometimes impossible results. You need to understand exactly how the data&apos;s being manipulated so you can see where the trouble areas are and how to resolve them. And then the third area of Conway&apos;s data science Venn diagram is substantive expertise. This is each domain or topic area has its own goals, methods, and constraints. If you&apos;re working in social media marketing, you&apos;re going to have a very different set of goals and methods than if you&apos;re working in biomedical informatics. And you need to know what constitutes value in the particular domain you&apos;re working in. And finally, how to implement the insights because data science is an action-oriented field. It&apos;s designed to tell you what to do next to get the most value, provide the best service that you possibly can based on the data that you have. So taken together, the hacking or programming, the math and statistics, and the substantive expertise are the individual elements or components, the parts that make up the larger-than-the-sum whole of data science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insights you get from data science can feel like a gift to your business, but you don&apos;t get to just open your hands and get it delivered to you with a bow on it. Really, there are a lot of moving parts and things that have to be planned and coordinated for all of this to work properly. I like to think of data science projects like walking down a pathway, where each step gets you closer to the goal that you have in mind. And with that I want to introduce you to a way of thinking about the data science pathway. It begins with planning your project. You first need to define your goals. What is it that you&apos;re actually trying to find out or accomplish? That way you can know when you&apos;re on target or when you need to redirect a little bit. You need to organize your resources. That can include things as simple as getting the right computers and the software, accessing the data, getting people and their time available. You need to coordinate the work of those people because data science is a team effort. Not everybody&apos;s going to be doing the same thing and some things have to happen first and some happen later. You also need to schedule the project so it doesn&apos;t expand to fill up an enormous amount of time. Time boxing, or saying we will accomplish this task in this amount of time, can be especially useful in working on a tight timeframe or you have a budget and you&apos;re working with a client. After planning, the next step is going to be wrangling, or preparing the data. That means you need to first get the data. You may be gathering new data, you may be using open data sources, you may be using public APIs, but you have to actually get the raw materials together. The next one, step six, is cleaning the data, which actually is an enormous task within data science. It&apos;s about getting the data ready so it fits into the paradigm, for instance, the program and the applications that you&apos;re using, that you can process it to get the insight that you need. Once the data&apos;s prepared and it&apos;s in your computer, you need to explore the data, maybe making visualizations, maybe doing some numerical summaries, a way of getting a feel of what&apos;s going on in there. And then, based on your exploration, you may need to refine the data. You may need to re-categorize cases. You may need to combine variables into new scores. Any of the things that can help you get it prepared for the insight. The third category in your data pathway is modeling. This is where you actually create the statistical model and you do the linear regression. You do the decision tree. You do the deep learning neural network. But then, you need to validate the model. How well do you know this is going to generalize from the current data set to other data sets. In a lot of research that step is left out and you often end up with conclusions that fall apart when you go to new places. So, validation&apos;s a very important part of this. The next step is evaluating the model. How well does it fit the data? What&apos;s the return on investment for it? How usable is it going to be? And then, based on those, you may need to refine the model. You may need to try processing a different way, adjust the parameters in your neural network, get additional variables to include in your linear regression. Any one of those can help you build a better model to achieve the goals that you had in mind in the first place. And then finally, the last part of the data pathway is applying the model and that includes presenting the model, showing what you learned to other people, to the decision makers, to the invested parties, to your client, so they know what it is that you&apos;ve found. Then you deploy the model. Say for instance, you created a recommendation engine. You actually need to put it online so that it can start providing these recommendations to clients or you put it into a dashboard so it can start providing recommendations to your decision makers. You will eventually need to revisit the model, see how well it&apos;s performing, especially when you have new data and maybe a new context in which it&apos;s operating. And then, you may need to revise it and try the process over again. And then finally, once you&apos;ve done all of this there&apos;s the matter of archiving the assets, really cleaning up after yourself is very important in data science. It includes documenting where the data came from and how you process it. It includes commenting the code that you used to analyze it. It includes making things future proof. All of these together can make the project more successful, easier to manage, easier to get the return on investment calculations for it, and those together will make the project more successful by following each of these steps. Taken together those steps on the pathway get you to your goal. It could be an amazing view at the end of your hike, or it could be an amazing insight into your business model, which was your purpose all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science is fundamentally a team sport. There are so many different skills and so many different elements involved in a data science project that you&apos;re going to need people from all sorts of different backgrounds with different techniques to contribute to the overall success of the project. I want to talk about a few of these important roles. The first one is the data engineers. These are the developers, and the system architects, the people who focus on the hardware and the software that make data science possible. They provide the foundation for all of the other analyses. They focus on the speed, and the reliability, and the availability of the work that you do. Next are machine learning specialists. These are people who have extensive work in computer science and in mathematics. They work in deep learning. They work in artificial intelligence. And they&apos;re the ones who have the intimate understanding of the algorithms and understand exactly how they&apos;re working with the data to produce the results that you&apos;re looking for. And then, an entirely different vein are people who are researchers, and by that I mean topical researchers. They focus on domain-specific research like, for instance, physics and genetics are common, so is astrophysics, so is medicine, so is psychology, and these kinds of researchers, while they connect with data science, they are usually better versed in the design of research within their particular field and doing common statistical analyses, that&apos;s where their expertise lies, but they connect with data science in that they&apos;re trying to find the answers to some of these big-picture questions that data scientists can also contribute to. Also, any business doing its job has analysts. These are people who do the day-to-day data tasks that are necessary for any business to run efficiently. Those include things like web analytics, and S-Q-L, that&apos;s SQL or Structured Query Language, data visualizations, and the reports that go into business intelligence. These allow people to make decisions. It&apos;s for good business decision-making that lets you see how you&apos;re performing, where you need to reorient, and how you can better reach your goals. Then there are the managers. These are the people who manage the entire data science project, and they&apos;re in charge of doing a couple of very important things. One is they need to frame the business-relevant questions and solutions. So, they&apos;re the ones who have the big picture. They know what they&apos;re trying to accomplish with that. And then, they need to keep people on track and moving towards it. And, to do that, they don&apos;t necessarily need to know how to do a neural network, they don&apos;t need to make the data visualization, but they need to speak data so they can understand how the data relates to the question they&apos;re trying to answer, and they can help take the information that the other people are getting and putting it together into a cohesive whole. Now, there are people who are entrepreneurs. And, in this case, you might have a data-based startup. The trick here is you often need all of the skills, including the business acumen, to make the business run well. You also need some great creativity in planning your projects and the execution that get you towards your entrepreneurial goals. And then there&apos;s the unicorn, also known as the rock star, or the ninja. This is a full-stack data scientist who can do it all, and do it at absolute peak performance. Well, it&apos;s a nice thing to have, on the other hand, that thing is very rare which is why we call them the unicorn. Also, you don&apos;t want to rely on one person for everything. Aside from the fact that they&apos;re hard to find, and sometimes hard to keep, you&apos;re only getting a single perspective or approach to your business questions, and you usually need something more diverse than that. And what suggests is the common approach to getting all the skills you need for a data project, and that is by team, and you can get a unicorn by team where you can get the people who have all the necessary skills, from the foundational data engineer, to the machine learning specialist, to the analyst, to the managers, all working together to get the insight from your data and help your project reach its greatest potential in moving your organization towards its own goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this exact moment in history, when people think about data science, the mind turns inexorably towards artificial intelligence, often with humanoid robots lost deep in thought. But before I compare and contrast data science and AI, I want to mention a few things about the nature of categories and definitions. First, categories are constructs, and by construct I mean something that you have to infer, something that is created in the mind, doesn&apos;t have this essential existence. It&apos;s a little bit like, when is something comedy and when is something performance art, and when is something acting? There&apos;s nothing that clearly separates one from the other. These are all mental categories, and the same thing is true of any category or definition, including things like data science and AI. The second one is that categories serve functional purposes. A letter opener is anything that&apos;s used to open letters. I actually use a knife to open letters. On the other hand, I know a family that uses knives to scoop ice cream exclusively. And, the tool is whatever you use it for. It&apos;s defined by its utility. The same thing is true of categories. And then finally, the use of categories varies by needs. If you&apos;re putting books on the shelf, you can use the Library of Congress system, the Dewey Decimal system. I know people who stack them by size or by color, or turn them around and do it decoratively. Any of those is going to work because they&apos;re serving different purposes. And so, when we&apos;re trying to think about categories and defining whether a particular activity is AI or whether it&apos;s data science, all of these principles are going to apply. A good example of this is the question of whether tomatoes are fruits or vegetables. Everyone knows that tomatoes are supposed to be fruit, but everyone also knows you&apos;d never put tomatoes in a fruit salad. Tomatoes go on veggie plates along with carrots and celery. The answer to this paradox, its fruit versus vegetable nature, is simple. The word fruit is a botanical term, and the word vegetable is a culinary term. They&apos;re not parallel or even very well coordinated systems of categorizations, which is why confusion can arise. It&apos;s a little like the joke about the bar that plays both kinds of music, country and western. The categories don&apos;t always divide logically or exclusively, and the same is true for artificial intelligence and data science. So, what exactly is artificial intelligence? Well I&apos;m going to let you know, there are a lot of different statements about this, and none of them are taken as definitive. And some of them I find to be useful, and some of them I find to be less useful. There&apos;s a little joke that AI means anything that computers can&apos;t do. Well, obviously, computers learn to do new things, but as soon as a computer learns how to do something, people say, well that&apos;s not intelligent, that&apos;s just a machine doing stuff. And so there&apos;s a sort of moving target here to this particular definition in terms of things computers can&apos;t do. You can also think of AI in terms of tasks that normally require humans. Like placing a phone call and making an appointment. Or like returning an email, or categorizing text. Traditionally humans have done that, but when a machine is able to do that, when a program&apos;s able to do it, that&apos;s probably a good example of artificial intelligence. Probably the most basic and useful definition is that artificial intelligence refers to programs that learn from data. And so, you give them some data, they build a model, and that that model adapts over time. A few common examples of this are things like categorizing photos. Is this a photo of a horse, a car, a balloon, a person? And programs learn how to do this by first having lots and lots, and lots, and lots of photos that are labeled by the people as one thing or another, as a cat or a dog. But then the algorithm is able to start learning on its own and abstracting the elements of the photo that best represent cat or dog. It&apos;s also used for translations going from one language, like English, to another, like French. The use of artificial intelligence programs has made enormous leaps in the ability of computers to do this automatically. Another one is games, like Go here. It was a very big deal when not very long ago a computer was able to beat the world champion of Go. And, it was thought to be this intuitive game that couldn&apos;t really be explained. What&apos;s fascinating about that is the computer actually taught itself how to play go. And, we&apos;ll talk a little more about that when we talk about the derivation of rules in another video. But all three of these can be good examples of artificial intelligence, simply by the sorts of things it&apos;s able to do. And so, probably, this is the best working definition of AI. And, while it can include even simple regression models, which really don&apos;t require much in the way of computing power, it usually refers to two approaches in particular. AI is usually referring to machine learning algorithms, and in particular, deep learning neural networks. I&apos;m going to talk about those more elsewhere, but I did want to bring up one more important distinction when talking about AI. And that&apos;s the difference between what is called strong or general AI, which is the idea that you can build a computer replica of the human brain that can solve any cognitive task. This is what happens in science fiction. You have a machine that&apos;s just like a human in a box. And that was the original goal of artificial intelligence back in the 50s, but it turned out that has been very difficult. Instead, you also have what is called weak or narrow, or specific, or focused AI. And these are algorithms that focus on one specific well defined task. Like, is this a photo of a cat or a photo of a dog? That has been where the enormous progress in AI has been over the last several years. So with all this in mind, how does artificial intelligence compare and contrast to data science? Well, it&apos;s a little bit like the fruit versus vegetable conundrum. Artificial intelligence means algorithms that learn from data. Broadly speaking, there&apos;s an enormous amount of overlap between our concept of AI and the field of machine learning. Data science on the other hand is the collection of skills and techniques for dealing with challenging data. You can see that these two are not exclusive. There&apos;s a lot of overlap between them, and AI nearly always involves the data science skillset. You basically can&apos;t do modern AI without data science. But there&apos;s an enormous amount of data science that does not involve artificial intelligence.  If you want to draw a diagram, I personally think of it this way. If this is data science, here&apos;s machine learning, ML. There&apos;s a lot of overlap between those two, and then within machine learning there&apos;s a specific approach called neural networks. Those have been amazingly productive, and AI refers to this diffuse, not well defined category that mostly overlaps with neural networks and with machine learning. And, it gets at some of the ambiguities, and some of the difficulty in separating these, which is why there&apos;s no consistent definition, and why there&apos;s so much debate over what one thing is, and what the other one is. But I will say this. Artificial intelligence has been enormously influential within the field of data science recently, even though data science has many other things that it does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the day a machine was just a machine. It did whatever machine things it did like stamping metal or turning a propellor or maybe washing your clothes with a fair amount of help on your part. But nowadays, machines have to do more than just their given mechanical function. Now a washing machine&apos;s supposed to be smart. It&apos;s supposed to learn about you and how you like your clothes and it&apos;s supposed to adjust its functions according to its sensors and it&apos;s supposed to send you a gentle message on your phone when it&apos;s all done taking care of everything. This is a big change, not just for washing machines, but for so many other machines and for data science processes as well. This gets to the issue of machine learning and a very simple definition of that is the ability of algorithms to learn from data and to learn in such a way that they can improve their function in the future. Now, learning is a pretty universal thing. Here&apos;s how humans learn. Humans, memorization is hard. On the other hand, spotting patterns is often pretty easy for humans as is reacting well and adaptively to new situations that resemble the old ones in many but not all ways. On the other hand, the way that machines learn is a little bit different. Unlike humans, memorization is really easy for machines. You can give them a million digits, it&apos;ll remember it perfectly and give it right back to you. But for a machine, for an algorithm, spotting patterns, in terms of here&apos;s a visual pattern, here&apos;s a pattern over time, those are much harder for algorithms. And new situations can be very challenging for algorithms to take what they learned previously and adapt it to something that may differ in a few significant ways. But the general idea is that once you figure out how machines learn and the ways that you can work with that, you can do some useful things. So for instance, there&apos;s the spam email and you get a new email and the algorithm can tell whether it&apos;s a spam. I used a couple of different email providers and I will tell you, some of them are much better at this than others. There&apos;s also image identification. For instance, telling whether this is a human face or who&apos;s face it is. Or there&apos;s the translation of languages where you enter text, either written or spoken, and it translates it back. A very complicated task for humans but something that machines have learned how to do much better than they used to. Still not 100% but getting closer all the time. Now, the important thing here is that you&apos;re not specifying all the criteria in each of these examples and you&apos;re not laying out a giant collection of if this then that statements in a flow chart. That would be something called an expert system. Those were created several decades ago and have been found to have limited utility and they&apos;re certainly not responsible for the modern developments of machine learning. Instead, a more common approach it really is to just teach your machine. You train it and the way you do that is you show the algorithm millions of labeled examples. If you&apos;re trying to teach it to identify photos of cats versus other animals, you give it millions of photos and you say this is a cat, this is a cat, this is not, this is not, this is. And then the algorithm finds its own distinctive features that are consistent across many of the examples of cats. Now what&apos;s important here is that the features, the things in the pictures that the algorithm latches onto may not be relevant to humans. We look at things like the eyes and the whiskers and the nose and the ears. It might be looking at the curve on the outside of the cheek relevant to the height of one ear to another. It might be looking just at a small patch of lines around the nose. Those may not be the things that humans latch onto and then sometimes they&apos;re not even visible to humans. It turns out that algorithms can find things that are very subtle, pixel by pixel changes in images or very faint sounds in audio patches or individual letters in text and it can respond to those. That&apos;s both a blessing and a curse. It means that it can find things that humans don&apos;t but it also can react in strange ways occasionally. But once you take all this training, you give your algorithm millions of labeled examples and it starts classifying things, well, then you want use something like a neural network which has been responsible for the major growth in machine learning and data science in the past five years or so. These diagrams here are different layouts of possible neural networks that go from the left to the right, some of them circle around or they return back to where they were. But all of these are different ways of taking the information and processing it. Now, the theory of neural networks or artificial neural networks has existed for years. The theory is not new. What&apos;s different, however, is that computing power has recently caught up to the demands that the theory places and in addition, the availability of labeled data primarily thanks to social media has recently caught up too. And so now we have this perfect combination. The theory has existed but the computing power and the raw data that it needs have both arrived to make it possible to do these computations that in many ways resembles what goes on in the human brain and then allow it to think creatively about the data, find its own patterns and label things. Now, I do want to say something about the relationship between data science and machine learning. Data science can definitely be done without machine learning. Any traditional classification task, logistic regression, decision tree. That&apos;s not usually machine learning and it&apos;s very effective data science. Most predictive models or even something like a sentiment analysis of social media text. On the other hand, machine learning without data science, well, you know, not so much. It&apos;s possible to do machine learning without extensive domain expertise so that&apos;s one element of data science. On the other hand, you would nearly always want to do this in collaboration with some sort of topical expert. Mostly I like to think of machine learning as a subdiscipline of data science. And that just brings up one more thing I want to say. The neural networks and the deep learning neural networks in particular that have been responsible for nearly all of these amazing developments in machine learning are a little bit of a black box which means it&apos;s hard to know exactly what the algorithm is looking at or how it&apos;s processing the data and one result of that is it kind of limits your ability to interpret what&apos;s going on even though the predictions in classifications can be amazingly accurate. I&apos;ll say more about neural networks and these issues elsewhere, but they highlight the trade-offs, the potential and the compromises that are inherent in some of these really exciting developments that have been taking place in one extraordinary influential part of the data science world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve ever been around a baby, you know that babies take very little steps. But the thing about baby steps is that you still get moving and eventually, babies grow and they take bigger steps. And before you know it, you&apos;ve got a world-class sprinter. And there&apos;s a similar thing, I like to think, that happens with neural networks. And what happens here is that tiny steps with data can lead to amazing analytical results. Now, an artificial neural network in computing is modeled roughly after the neurons that are inside a biological brain. Those neurons are nothing more than simple on and off switches that are connecting with each other, but give rise to things like love and consciousness. In the computing version, the idea is to take some very basic pieces of information, and by connecting it with many other nodes, you can give rise to the sort of emergent behavior, which really is very high-level cognitive decisions and classifications. It works this way. Over here on the left, you start with an input layer. That&apos;s where your raw data comes in. And then, it gets passed along to one or more hidden layers. That&apos;s what makes it a neural network, that you have these hidden layers. And these lines all represent connections like the connections between neurons in a biological brain. And then, after going through several hidden layers, you have an output layer, which is where you get the final classification or decision about what&apos;s happening. And I want to give you an example of how this might work. Now, please understand, this is an analogy. The actual operation of neural networks is much more complicated and sometimes a little more mysterious than what&apos;s going on here. But let&apos;s take a simple example where you&apos;re taking your input data from a digital image. In that case, for each pixel in the image, you&apos;re going to have basically five pieces of information. You&apos;re going to have the X and Y coordinates of that pixel. And then, for that pixel, you&apos;re going to have its red, green, and blue color components. And then you&apos;re going to repeat these five things for every pixel in the image. But that&apos;s your raw input data. Those are numerical values. And you put those into the input layer. And then, what it does is it starts to combine these different X and Y positions and the RGB colors, and then, it decides whether it has found a line. Does this represent a distinct line against a color background? So, that might be the first layer. And then, from there, it&apos;s going to say, I&apos;ve found some lines, and now I&apos;m going to see if I can combine those lines to determine whether that line is the edge of an object as opposed to some sort of service marker. And then, if I found edges, I can then take the information about edges and then combine that to determine what&apos;s the shape that I&apos;m looking at. Is it a circle, a square, a hexagon, or something much more complex than that? And then maybe, it takes all of this shape information and then it goes to the output layer, and it says what the actual object is. So, we&apos;ve gone from the X Y RGB pieces of information about each pixel, and we&apos;ve put that in. And we&apos;ve gone to lines and we&apos;ve gone to edges, and then to shapes, and then possibly to objects. That&apos;s one idea of how a neural network, and especially a deep-learning neural network, which has many hidden layers, might work. If you want to see something that&apos;s slightly more complicated, here&apos;s an example. And neural networks can potentially have millions of neurons. There can be a lot of stuff going on in there. And they might be arranged in a lot of different ways. These are called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;feedforward ones&lt;/code&gt;, where the information starts on the left and just kind of keeps moving forward to the right. But there are a lot of other potential arrangements for the data transfers within a neural network. These are some of the possible examples. They behave slightly differently. You&apos;ll want to use some of the different versions in different circumstances. There is one interesting thing, though. Just like a human brain, things can get a little complicated in a neural network, or really massively complicated. And it can be hard to know exactly what it is that&apos;s going on inside there. What that means is you actually have to resort to inference. You sometimes have to infer how the neural network is functioning. What is it looking at? How is it processing that information? And curiously, that means you actually have to use some of the same methods as psychological researchers who are trying to find out what&apos;s going on inside a human brain. You are testing and then inferring the processes that are going on. One other really important thing to keep in mind about neural networks is there&apos;s a collection of legal issues that apply to these that don&apos;t quite apply the same way to other forms of machine learning or data science. For instance, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;European Union&amp;#39;s General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/code&gt;, better known as just &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/code&gt;, is a collection of policies that govern privacy and really how organizations gather and process information that they get from people. One really important part of this that relates to neural networks is what&apos;s called a  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;right to explanation&lt;/code&gt;. If a person feels that they have been harmed by a decision made by a neural network, such as it refused a loan application, they can sue the organization and demand an explanation. How did it reach that process? Now, because neural networks are so complicated, they tend to be kind of opaque and it&apos;s hard to know what&apos;s going on. You may have a difficult situation explaining exactly how it got there. That&apos;s a problem, because there are some very stiff fines associated with violations of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/code&gt;. So, you will want to get a little more information on this. If you&apos;re going to be using neural networks, you owe it to yourself to spend a little bit of time on the social context and on the legal context of how these things work. But the most exciting thing about them is the amazing progress that&apos;s been made in machine learning over just the past few years with neural networks and deep-learning neural networks, in particular, to model the general processes going on in the human brain, and to be able to reach some very, very sophisticated and a highly accurate conclusions based on that processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time just a few years ago when data science and big data were practically synonymous terms as were semi-magical words like Hadoop that brought up all the amazing things happening in data science. But things are a little different now, so it&apos;s important to distinguish between the two fields. I&apos;ll start by reminding you what we&apos;re talking about when we talk about big data. Big data is data that is characterized by any or all of three characteristics. Unusual volume, unusual velocity, and unusual variety. Again, singly or together can constitute big data. Let me talk about each of these in turn. First, volume. The amount of data that&apos;s become available even over the last five years is really extraordinary. Things like customer transactions at the grocery store. The databases that track these transactions and compile them and consumer loyalty programs have hundreds of billions of rows of data on purchases. GPS data from a phone includes information from billions of people constantly throughout the day. Or scientific data, for instance, this image of the black hole in Messier 97 from the Event Horizon Telescope that was released in April of 2019. It involved half a ton of hard drives that had to be transported on airplanes to central processing locations because that was several times faster than trying to use the internet. Any one of these is an overwhelming dataset for normal method, and that brought about some of the most common technologies associated with the big data, distributed file systems like Hadoop, that made it possible to take these collections that were simply too big to fit on any one computer, any one drive, put it across many, and still be able to integrate them in ways that let you get collective intelligence out of them. Then there&apos;s velocity. The prime culprit in this one is social media. YouTube gets 300 hours of new video uploaded every single minute. That gets about five billion views per day. Instagram had 95 million posts per day, and that was back in 2016 when it only had half as many users as it does not. And Facebook generates about four petabytes of data per day. The data is coming in so fast it&apos;s a fire hose that no common methods that existed before the big data revolution could handle it. This required new ways of transporting data, integrating data, and being able to update your analyses constantly to match the new information. And then finally there&apos;s the variety, probably one of the most important elements of big data. That included things like multimedia data, images, and video, and audio. Those don&apos;t fit into spreadsheets. Or biometric data, facial recognition, your fingerprints, your heart readings, and when you move the mouse on your computer to find out where the cursor went, that&apos;s a distinctive signature that&apos;s recorded and identified for each user. And then there&apos;s graph data. That&apos;s the data about the social networks and the connections between people. That requires a very special kind of database. Again, doesn&apos;t fit into the regular rows and columns of conventional dataset. So all of these showed extraordinary challenges for simply getting the data in, let alone knowing how to process it in useful ways. Now it is possible to distinguish big data and data science. For instance, you can do big data without necessarily requiring the full toolkit of data science, which includes computer programming, math and statistics, and domain expertise. So for instance, you might have a large dataset, but if it&apos;s structured and very consistent, maybe you don&apos;t have to do any special programming. Or you have streaming data. It&apos;s coming in very fast. But only has a few variables, a few kinds of measurements. Again, you can set it up once and kind of run with it as you go. And so that might be considered big data, but doesn&apos;t necessarily require the full range of skills of data science. You can also have data science without big data. And that&apos;s anytime you have a creative combination of multiple datasets or you have unstructured texts like social media posts. Or you&apos;re doing data visualization. You may not have large datasets with these, but you&apos;re definitely going to need the programming ability and the mathematical ability as well as the topical expertise to make these work well. So now that I&apos;ve distinguished them I want to return to one particularly important question. You can find this on the internet. And the question is, is big data dead? Because it&apos;s interest peaked about four or five years ago. And it looks like it&apos;s been going down since then. So is big data passed? Is it no longer there? Well, it&apos;s actually quite the opposite. It turns out that big data is alive and well. It&apos;s everywhere. It has simply become the new normal for data. The practices that it introduced, the techniques that it made possible are used every single day now in the data science world. And so while it&apos;s possible to separate big data and data science, the two become so integrated now that big data is simply taken for granted as an element of the new normal in the data world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person is convicted of a crime, a judge has to decide what the appropriate response is and how that might help bring about positive outcomes. One interesting thing that can contribute to that is what&apos;s called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;restorative justice&lt;/code&gt;. This is a form of justice that focuses on repair to the harm done as opposed to punishment, and it often involves, at the judge&apos;s discretion and the victim&apos;s desire, mediation between the victim and the offender. Now one of the interesting things about this is it&apos;s a pretty easy procedure, and it has some very significant outcomes. Participating in restorative justice predicts improved outcomes on all of the following. People feel that they were able to tell their story and that their opinion was considered. They feel that the process or outcome was fair. They feel that the judge or mediator was fair. They feel that the offender was held accountable. An apology or forgiveness was offered. There&apos;s a better perception of the other party at the end of all of this. The victim is less upset about the crime. The victim is less afraid of revictimization. Those are absolutely critical. And then one more is that there&apos;s a lower recidivism rate. Offenders who go through restorative justice are less likely to commit crimes again in the future. All of these are very significant outcomes and can be predicted with this one relatively simple intervention of restorative justice. And so when a judge is trying to make a decision, this is one thing they can keep in mind in trying to predict a particular outcome. Now in the world of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;predictive analytics&lt;/code&gt;, where you&apos;re using data to try to predict outcomes, the restorative justice is a very simple one based on simple analysis. Within data science and predictive analytics, you&apos;ll see more complicated things like, for instance, whether a person is more likely to click on a particular button or make a purchase based on a particular offer. You&apos;re going to see medical researchers looking at things that can predict the risk of a disease as well as the responsiveness of particular treatments. You&apos;ll also look at things like the classification of photos, and what&apos;s being predicted there is whether a machine can accurately predict what a human would do if they did the same particular task. These are all major topics within the field of predictive analytics. Now the relationship between data science and predictive analytics is very vaguely like this. Data science is there, predictive analytics is there, and there&apos;s a lot of overlap. An enormous amount of the work in predictive analytics is done by data science researchers. There are a few important meeting points at that intersection between the two, so predictions that involve difficult data, if you&apos;re using unstructured data like social media posts or a video that doesn&apos;t fit into the nice rows and columns of a spreadsheet. You&apos;re probably going to need data science to do that. Similarly, predictions that involve sophisticated models like the neural network we have here, those require some really high-end programming to make them happen. And so data science is going to be important to those particular kinds of predictive analytics projects. On the other hand, it&apos;s entirely possible to do predictions without the full data science tool kit. If you have clean, quantitative data sets, nice rows and columns of numbers, then you&apos;re in good shape. And if you&apos;re using a common model like a linear regression or a decision tree, both of which are extremely effective, but they&apos;re also pretty easy to do and pretty easy to interpret. So in these situations, you can do useful and accurate predictions without having to have the entire background of data science. Also, it&apos;s possible to do data science without necessarily being involved in the business of predictions. If you&apos;re doing things like clustering cases or counting how often something happens, or mapping like what we see here, or a data visualization, these can be significant areas of data science, depending both on the data that you&apos;re bringing in and the methods that you&apos;re using. But they don&apos;t involve predictions per se, and so what this lets you know is that while data science can contribute significantly to the practice of predictive analytics, they are still distinguishable fields, and depending on your purposes, you may or may not need the full range of data science skills, the full took kit to get to your predictive purposes. But either way, you&apos;re going to be able to get more insight into how people are likely to react and how you can best adapt to those situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s an article of faith for me that any organization will do better by using data to help with their strategy, and with their day-to-day decisions. But it reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from over 100 years ago. William James was one of the founders of American psychology and philosophy, and he&apos;s best known for functionalism in psychology and pragmatism in philosophy, and he had this to say: he said, &quot;My thinking is first and last and always for the sake of my doing.&quot; That was summarized by another prominent American psychologist, Susan Fiske, as, &quot;Thinking is for doing.&quot; The point is, when we think, the way that our brain works, it&apos;s not just there because it&apos;s there, it&apos;s there to serve a particular purpose. And I think the same thing is true about data and data science in general. In fact, I like to say data is for doing. The whole point of gathering data, the whole point of doing the analysis, is to get some insight that&apos;s going to allow us to do something better. And truthfully, business intelligence is the one field that epitomizes this goal. Business intelligence, or B.I., is all about getting the insight to do something better in your business. And business intelligence methods, or B.I. methods, are pretty simple. They are designed to emphasize speed, and accessibility, and insight, right there. You can do them on your tablet, you can do them on your phone. And they often rely on structured dashboards. Maybe you do a social media campaign, and you can go and see the analytics dashboard. Or you have videos on YouTube, or Vimeo, or someplace. You can get the analytics and see how well is this performing, who&apos;s watching it and when. That&apos;s a business intelligence dashboard of a form. So, if this is all about the goal of data, that data is for doing, and B.I. does that so well, where does data science come in to all of this? Well, it actually comes in sort of before the picture. Data science helps set things up for business intelligence, and I&apos;ll give you a few examples. Number one, data science can help tremendously in collecting, and cleaning, and preparing, and manipulating the data. In fact, some of the most important developments in business intelligence, say, for instance, companies like Domo. Their major property is about the way that they ingest and process the information to make it easily accessible to other people. Next, data science can be used to build the models that predict the particular outcomes. So, you will have a structure there in your data, that will be doing, for instance, a regression, or a decision tree, or some other model to make sense of the data. And while a person doesn&apos;t have to specifically manipulate that, it&apos;s available to them, and that&apos;s what produces the outcomes that they&apos;re seeing. And then finally, two of the most important things you can do in business intelligence are find trends, to predict what&apos;s likely to happen next, and to flag anomalies. This one&apos;s an outlier, something may be wrong here, or we may have a new case with potential hidden value. Any one of those is going to require some very strong data science to do it well. Even if the user-facing element is a very simple set of graphs on a tablet, the data science goes into the preparation and the offering of the information. And so really, I like to think of it this way: Data science is what makes business intelligence possible. You need data science to get the information together from so many different sources, and sometimes doing complex modeling. And also, I like to think, that business intelligence gives purpose to data science. It&apos;s one of the things that helps fulfill the goal-driven, application-oriented element of data science. And so, data science makes B.I. possible, but B.I. really shows to the best extent how data science can be used to make practical decisions that make organizations function more effectively and more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we think about Artificial Intelligence and how it works, and how it might make decisions, and act on it&apos;s own, we tend to think of things like this. You&apos;ve got the robot holding the computer right next to you. But the fact is, most of the time when we&apos;re dealing with Artificial Intelligence, it&apos;s something a lot closer to this. Nevertheless, I want to suggest at least four ways that working data science can contribute to the interplay of human and Artificial Intelligence of personal and machine agency. The first is what I call simple Recommendations. And then there&apos;s Human-in-the-Loop decision making. Then Human-Accessible decisions, and then Machine-Centric processing and action. And I want to talk a little more about each of these. Let&apos;s start with Recommendations. This is where the algorithm processes your data and makes a recommendation, or suggestion to you and you can either take it or leave it. A few places where this approach shows up are things like, for instance, online shopping, where you have a recommendation engine that says &quot;Based on your past purchase history, &quot;you might want to look at this.&quot; Or, the same thing with online movies or music, it looks at what you did, it looks at what you like, and it suggests other things. And, you can decide whether you want to pick up on that or not. Another one is an online News Feed. This says &quot;Based on what you&apos;ve clicked in the past &quot;and the things that you&apos;ve selected, &quot;you might like this.&quot; It&apos;s a little bit different, because this time it&apos;s just a yes or no decision. But, it&apos;s still up to you what you click on. Another one is Maps, where you enter your location and it suggests a route to you based on traffic, based on time and you can follow it or you can do something else if you want. But in all of these, data science is being used to take, truly, a huge amount of information about your own past behavior, about what other people have done under similar circumstances, and how that can be combined to give the most likely recommendations to you. But, the agency still rests in the human. They get to decide what to do. Next is Human-in-the-Loop decision making. And, this is where advanced algorithms can make and even implement their own decisions, as with self-driving cars. And, I remember the first time my car turned it&apos;s steering wheel on it&apos;s own. But humans are usually at the ready to take over, if needed. Another example might be something as simple as spam filters. You go in every now and then, and you check up on how well it&apos;s performing. So, it can do it on it&apos;s own, but you need to be there to take over just in case. A third kind of decision making in the interplay between the algorithm and the human is what I call Human-Accessible decision making. Many algorithmic decisions are made automatically, and even implemented automatically. But they&apos;re designed such that humans can at least understand what happened in them. Such as, for instance, with an online mortgage application. You put the information in, and it can tell you immediately whether you&apos;re accepted or rejected. But because of recent laws, such as the European Union GDPR, that&apos;s the General Data Protection Regulation, the organizations who run these algorithms need to be able to interpret how it reached its decision. Even if they&apos;re not usually involving humans in making of the decisions, it still has to be open to humans. And then finally, there&apos;s Machine-Centric. And this is when machines are talking to other machines. And the best example of this is the internet of things. And that can include things like Wearables. My smart watch talks to my phone, which talks to the internet, which talks to my car in sharing and processing data at each point. Also Smart Homes. You can say hello to your Smart Speaker which turns on the lights, adjusts the temperature, starts the coffee, plays the news and so on. And there are Smart Grids, which allows for example, for two way communication between maybe a power utility and the houses or businesses they serve. It lets them have more efficient routing end of power, recovery from blackouts, integration with consumer generated power, and so on. The important thing about this one is this last category, the Machine-Centric decisions or the internet of things, is starting to constitute an enormous amount of the data that&apos;s available for data science work. But any one of these approaches from the Simple Recommendations up to the Machine-Centric, all of them show the different kinds of relationships between data, human decision makers, and machine algorithms, and the conclusions that they reach. Any one of these is going to work in different circumstances. And so it&apos;s your job, as somebody who may be working in data science, to find the best balance of the speed and efficiency of machine decision making and respect for the autonomy and individuality of the humans that you&apos;re interacting with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science can make you feel like a superhero who&apos;s here to save the world or at least your business&apos;s world. But an alarming amount of data work can also end up in court or on the wrong side of a protest so I want to talk about a few things that can help keep you, your company and your data science work on the up and up. First, there are some important legal issues. Now it used to be when data science first came about, you know, oh, 10 years ago, we were kind of in the Wild West and people just kind of did what they wanted but now we&apos;ve had some major developments in the legal frameworks that govern data and its use. Probably the most important of these is an entire collection of privacy laws, the most significant of which at the moment is the GDPR, that&apos;s the European Union&apos;s General Data Protection Regulation. This is a law about privacy that has some very serious teeth. It can potentially have fines of billions of dollars for companies that seriously violate its policies. This is why you have so many cookie notices and why opting in becomes such an important thing when you go to a website. And in the United States, there are a lot of other regulations that also affect privacy, things like HIPAA, that&apos;s the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. And then there are state laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act. All of these place serious regulations on how you can gather data, the consent that you need to get from people, what you can do from the data, whether people can request it, whether they can be forgotten from the system and it&apos;s important for you to remember all of these so you don&apos;t end up crossing a very significant line when doing your work. And I want to remind you, it&apos;s not just the 31 member states of the European Union and the European Economic Area that have these kinds of privacy laws. They&apos;re spreading around all over the world and there are more coming every day. I mean, that&apos;s an awful lot of the world that&apos;s covered by these various regulations that you need to keep in mind when doing your work. The next thing is ethical issues. These may or may not specifically address legal barriers but they have a lot to do with how your work is perceived. Now for instance, there are the three forms of fairness. We talked about distributing things by equity, that is proportional to some kind of input or equality, everybody gets the same amount or need, the people who need the most, and get the most. Or forms of justice. This includes distributive justice which is the actual things that you end up with, procedural justice, how are the decisions made and interactional justice, how is the decision communicated? How are people involved in it? And then there&apos;s issues of authenticity. You need to know who you&apos;re dealing with and what you&apos;re dealing with and none of these specifically address legal issues but they have a very big impact on whether people feel that your organization and your work is ethical and can be trusted and whether they want to engage with you. And that finally gets to the social issues. Whenever you or your company or clients engage with people, you need to engage with them with respect. People don&apos;t like getting fooled, they don&apos;t like getting exploited, they don&apos;t like getting ignored and all of those are serious risks when working with data and don&apos;t forget that unpopular projects can lead to protests, by the general populace and walkouts by the people in your own company and so, there&apos;s a lot more that I could say about all of these. I do say a lot more about every one of these elements and all of them can have an impact on your ability to use data to do something that&apos;s productive for your company but not just in the short term, also in the long term in a way that is sustainable and respective of the people and the environment that you work in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody who&apos;s cooked knows how time-consuming food prep can be, and that doesn&apos;t say anything about actually going to the market, finding the ingredients, putting things together in bowls and sorting them, let alone cooking the food. And it turns out there&apos;s a similar kind of thing that happens in data science, and that&apos;s the data preparation part. The rule of thumb is that 80% of the time on any data science project is typically spent just getting the data ready. So data preparation, 80%, and everything else falls into about 20%, and you know, that can seem massively inefficient and you may wonder what is your motivation to go through something that&apos;s so time consuming and really, this drudgery? Well, if you want in one phrase, it&apos;s GIGO, that is garbage in, garbage out. That&apos;s a truism from computer science. The information you&apos;re going to get from your analysis is only as good as the information that you put into it, and if you want to put in really starker terms, there&apos;s a wonderful phrase from Twitter, and it says most people who think that they want machine learning or AI really just need linear regression on cleaned-up data. Linear regression is a very basic, simple, and useful procedure and it lets you know just as a rule of thumb, if your data is properly prepared, then the analysis can be something that is quick and clean and easy and easy to interpret. Now when it comes to data preparation and data science, one of the most common phrases you&apos;ll hear is tidy data, which seems a little bit silly, but the concept comes from data scientist Hadley Wickham, and it refers to a way of getting your data set up so it can be easily imported into a program and easily organized and manipulated. And it revolves around some of these very basic principles. Number one, each column in your file is equivalent to a variable, and each row in your file is the same thing as a case or observation. Also you should have one sheet per file. If you have an Excel sheet, you know you can have lots of different sheets in it, but a CSV file has only one sheet and also that each file should have just one level of observations. So you might have a sheet on orders, another one on the SKUs, another one on individual clients, another one on companies and so on and so forth. If you do this, then it makes it very easy to import the data and to get the program up and running. Now this stuff may seem really obvious and you say, well, why do we even have to explain that? It&apos;s because data in spreadsheets frequently is not tidy. You have things like titles and you have images and figures and graphs and you have merged cells and you have color to indicate some data value or you have sub-tables within the sheet or you have summary values or you have comments and notes that might actually contain important data. All of that can be useful if you&apos;re never going beyond that particular spreadsheet, but if you&apos;re trying to take it into another program, all of that gets in the way. And then there are other problems that show up in any kind of data. Things like, for instance, do you actually know what the variable and value labels are? Do you know what the name of this variable is? &apos;Cause sometimes, they&apos;re cryptic. Or what does a three on employment status mean? Do you have missing values where you should have data? Do you have misspelled text? If people are writing down the name of the town that they live in or the company they work for, they could write that really in infinite number of ways. Or in a spreadsheet, it&apos;s not uncommon for numbers to accidentally be represented in the spreadsheet as text, and then you can&apos;t do numerical manipulations with it. And then there&apos;s a question of what to do with outliers and then there&apos;s metadata, things like where did the data come from? Who&apos;s the sample? How was it processed? All of this is information you need to have in order to have a clean dataset that you know the context and the circumstances around it that you can analyze it. And that&apos;s to say nothing about trying to get data out of things like scanned PDFs or print tables or print graphs, all of which require either a lot of manual transcription or a lot of very fancy coding. I mean, even take something as simple as emojis, which are now a significant and meaningful piece of communication, especially in social media. This is the rolling on the floor laughing emoji. There are at least 17 different ways of coding this digitally. Here&apos;s a few of them, and if you&apos;re going to be using this as information, you need to prepare your data to code all of these in one single way so that you can then look at these summaries all together and try to get some meaning out of it. I know it&apos;s a lot of work, but just like food prep, is a necessary step to get something beautiful and delicious. Data prep is a necessary, vital step to get something meaningful and actionable out of your data. So give it the time and the attention it deserves, you&apos;ll be richly rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science projects can feel like this epic expedition or this massive group project. But sometimes, you can get started right here, right now. That is, your organization may already have the data that you need. And there a few major advantages to using this kind of in-house data. The first is it&apos;s fast. It&apos;s the fastest way to start. It&apos;s right there and it&apos;s ready to go. An interesting one is that certain restrictions on data may not apply for use that is entirely within the boundaries of your organization. So if you have data that includes individual identifiers, you may be able to use that for your organization&apos;s own research. Next, you may actually be able to talk with the people who gathered the data in the first place. You can have questions for them. They can tell you how they sampled it, what the things mean, why they did it in this particular way, all of that can save you an enormous amount of time and headaches, and also it may be in the same format that you currently need. And what that means, is that pieces may fit together perfectly. They may have the same code, they may have the same software, they may use the same standards and style guides, and that can save you a lot of time. On the other hand, there are some potential downsides to in-house data. Number one is, if it was an ad-hoc project, it may not be well documented. They may have just kind of thrown it together, and never quite put in all the information about it. It may not be well maintained. Maybe they gathered it five years ago, and kind of let it slip since then. And the biggest one is the data simply may not exist. Maybe what you need really isn&apos;t there in your organization. And so, in-house isn&apos;t an option in that particular case. So, there are some potential downsides. But really, the benefits are so big, are so meaningful, that it&apos;s always worth your time to take just a few minutes to look around and see what&apos;s there, and get started on your project right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When You draw a picture or write a letter, chances are that you can draw well with one of your hands, your dominant hand and not so much with the other. I recently heard someone describe this as having a well developed API for your dominant hand but only a clunky one for the non-dominant hand. An API or Application Programming Interface isn&apos;t a source of data but rather it&apos;s a way of sharing data, it can take data from one application to another or from a server to your computer. It&apos;s the thing that routes the data, translates it, and gets it ready for use. I want to show you a simple example of how this works. So I&apos;ve gone to this website that has what&apos;s called the JSON Placeholder. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, it&apos;s a data format, tiny piece of code and what it says is go to this web address and get the data there and then show it, include it and you can just click on this to see what it does. There&apos;s the data in JSON format. If you want to go to just this web address directly, you can and there&apos;s the same data. You can include this information in a Python script or a R script or some other web application that you are developing. It brings it in and it allows you to get up and running very, very quickly. Now API&apos;s can be used for a million different things, three very common categories include social API&apos;s that allow you to access data from Twitter or Facebook and other sources as well as use them as logins for your own sites. Utilities, things like Dropbox and Google Maps so you can include that information in your own apps. Or commerce, Stripe for processing payments or MailChimp for email marketing or things like Slack or a million other applications. The data can be opened which means all you need is the address to get it or it maybe proprietary maybe you have to have a subscription or you purchase it and then you&apos;ll need to log in. But the general process is the same. You include this byte code and it brings the data in and gets you up and running, you can then use that data in data analysis, so it becomes one step of a data science project or maybe your creating a app, you can make a commercial application that relies on data that it pulls from any of several different API&apos;s like weather and directions. Really the idea here is that API&apos;s are teamwork. API&apos;s facilitate the process of bringing things together and then adding value to your analysis and to the data science based services that you offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people think about data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence, the talk turns almost immediately to tools. Things like programming languages and sophisticated computer setups, but remember, the tools are simply a means to an end, and even then only a part of it. The most important part of any data science project by far is the question itself, and the creativity that comes in exploring that question, and working to find possible answers using the tools that best match your questions. And sometimes, those tools are simple ones. It&apos;s good to remember even in data science that we should start with the simple, and not move on to the complicated until it&apos;s necessary. And for that reason, I suggest we start with data science applications. And so, you may wonder, &quot;Why apps?&quot; Well number one, they&apos;re more common. They&apos;re generally more accessible, more people are able to use them. They&apos;re often very good for exploring the data, browsing the data. And they can be very good for sharing. Again, because so many people have them and know how to use them. By far the most common application for data work is going to be the humble spreadsheet, and there are a few reasons why this should be the case. Number one, I consider spreadsheets the universal data tool. It&apos;s my untested theory that there are more datasets in spreadsheets than in any other format in the world. The rows and columns are very familiar to a very large number of people and they know how to explore the data and access it using those tools. The most common by far is Microsoft Excel and its many versions. Google Sheets is also extremely common, and there are others. The great thing about spreadsheets is they&apos;re good for browsing. You sort through the data, you filter the data. It makes it really easy to get a hands-on look at what&apos;s going on in there. They&apos;re also great for exporting and sharing the data. Any program in the world can read a .csv file, a &quot;comma separated values&quot;, which is the generic version of a spreadsheet. Your client will probably give you the data in a spreadsheet, they&apos;ll probably want the results back in a spreadsheet. You can do want in-between, but that spreadsheet is going to serve as the common ground. Another very common data tool, even though it&apos;s not really an application, but a language, is S-Q-L or SQL, which stands for &quot;Structured Query Language.&quot; This is a way of accessing data storing databases, usually relational databases, where you select the data, you specify the criteria you want, you can combine it and reformat in ways that best work. You only need maybe a dozen or so commands in SQL to accomplish the majority of tasks that you need. So a little bit of familiarity with SQL is going to go a very long way. And then there are the dedicated apps for visualization. That includes things like Tableau, both the desktop and the public and server version, and Qlik. What these do is they facilitate data integration, that&apos;s one of their great things. They bring in data from lots of different sources and formats, and put it together in a pretty seamless way. Their purpose is interactive data exploration. To click on set groups, to drill down, to expand what you have, and they&apos;re very very good at that. And then there are apps for data analysis. So these are applications that are specifically designed for point-and-click data analysis. And I know a lot of data scientists think that coding is always better at everything, but the point-and-click graphical user interface makes things accessible to a very large number of people. And so this includes common programs like SPSS, or JASP, or my personal favorite, jamovi. JASP and jamovi are both free and open source. And what they do is they make the analysis friendly. Again, the more people you can get working with data, the better, and these applications are very good at democratizing data. But whatever you do, just remember to stay focused on your question, and let the tools and the techniques follow your question. Start simple, with the basic applications, and move on only as the question requires it. That way, you can be sure to find the meaning and the value as you uncover it in your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the saxophone. I play it very badly but I love to listen to it and one of the curious things about the saxophone is that if you want to play gigs professionally you can&apos;t play just the saxophone at the very least you have to play both the alto and tenor saxophone as well as the flute and the clarinet and for other gigs you may need to be able to play obo, English horn, bassoon bass clarinet, and even recorder and chrome horn like one of my teachers. You have to be a musical polyglot. I mention this because one of the most common questions in data science is whether you should work in Python or in R, two very common languages for working with data. The reason this question comes up is because programming languages give you immense control over your work and data science. You may find that your questions go beyond the capabilities of data analysis applications and so the ability to create something custom tailored that matches your needs exactly, which is the whole point of data science in the first place is going to be critical. But let me say something more about Python and R Now Python is currently the most popular language for data science and machine learning. It&apos;s a general purpose programming language. You can do anything with Python and people do enormous numbers of things that are outside of data science with it. Also, Python code is very clean and it&apos;s very easy to learn So there are some great advantages to Python R on the other hand, is a programming language that was developed specifically for work in data analysis. And R is still very popular with scientists and with researchers. Now, there are some important technical differences between the two such as the fact that R works natively with vectorized operations and as non standard evaluation and Python manages memory and large data sets better in its default setup but neither of those is fixed, both of them can be adapted to do other things. And really, the thumb of this is that like any professional saxophonist is going to need to be able to play several different instruments any professional data scientist is going to need to be able to work comfortably in several different languages. So those languages can include both Python and R they can include SQL or Structured Query Language or Java or Julia or Scala or MATLAB really, all of these serve different purposes they overlap but depending both on the question that you are trying to answer, the kind of data that you have, and the level at which you&apos;re working, you may need to work with some, many or all of these. Now, I do want to mention one other reason why programming languages are so helpful in data science and that&apos;s because you can expand their functionality with packages these are collections of code that you can download that give extra functionality or facilitate the entire process of working with data and often, it is the packages that are more influential than the actual language. So things like TensorFlow which make it so easy to do deep learning neural networks you can use that in Python or in R and it&apos;s going to facilitate your work but no matter what language you use and what packages you use it is true that the programming languages that are used in data science are going to give you this really fine level control over your analysis and let you tailor it to the data and to the questions that you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that is most predictable about technology is that things get faster, smaller, easier, and better over time. This is the essence of Moore&apos;s Law, which originally talked about just the density of transistors on circuits doubling every two years, but think about, for instance, the women working here on ENIAC, that&apos;s the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, which was the first electronic general-purpose computer back in 1945. It was huge. It filled up a room and it took a whole team of people to run it. Then things evolved, for instance, to very colorful reel-to-reel computers, then you get your desktop Macintosh, I still have my Classic II, and before you know it, you&apos;re running your billion-dollar tech company from your cell phone. One of the most important developments in the internet era has been SaaS, or software as a service. Just think of anytime you&apos;ve used an online application like Excel Online instead of an application installed locally on your computer like the regular desktop version of Excel. That is a way of making the application more accessible because anybody can get onto it with any machine connected to the internet, and really more useful to people. Well, a similar revolution is happening now in data science with machine learning as a service. It&apos;s not as easy to pronounce MLaaS, but it&apos;s a way of making the entire process of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence easier to access, easier to setup, and easier to get going. All the major cloud data providers have recently announced these machine learning as a service offerings. So for instance, there&apos;s Microsoft Azure ML, there&apos;s Amazon Machine Learning, and Google AutoML, and IBM Watson Analytics, and all of these have some very closely-related advantages, things that make your life a lot easier. Number one, they put the analysis where the data is stored. You&apos;ve got your massive and complex data sets but they&apos;re stored in the servers that each of these services have, and so you don&apos;t have to do an export and import, you just go right where the data is. Also, most of them give you very flexible computing requirements. It&apos;s not like you have to purchase the hardware. You can rent CPUs and GPUs. You can rent RAM and hard drive space as you need it. They also frequently give you a drag-and-drop interface that makes the programming and the setup of the analysis dramatically easier. Again, the point here is that it democratizes the process, it makes it more accessible for more people in more circumstances. And that is part of the promise of data science. Now, it&apos;s too early to project very far into the future and see what all of the exact consequences of this revolution will be, especially because new services are being announced and major changes are being made all the time. But the idea, again, with machine learning as a service is that it puts the analysis where the data is and it makes it more open and more available to more people. Again, it&apos;s the democratization of data science, and that&apos;s the promise of machine learning as a service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be the end of this article, but it&apos;s just a beginning for you. And so it&apos;s time for you to start making plans on how you are going to produce your own data science revolution. I want you to remember that this article is designed to be a foundation, it&apos;s an introduction that gives you a feel for the breadth and depth of data science. I haven&apos;t been able to go into detail on these topics, but that&apos;s okay. Consider learning new things, like, for instance, how to program in Python or R, or how to work with open data, or how to build algorithms for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Any of these would be fantastically useful tools and approaches in data science. Also, learn how to apply the things that you&apos;ve worked with. Read some articles on data-driven decision making in business settings, get more information on business strategy and how the information you use can help any organization make better decisions in their own operations. And then get information on how people work, and the elements that are most important in fields like marketing or nonprofits or healthcare or education, or whatever is of greatest use and interest to you. Also, get connected with the actual people in data science. Go to conferences, there&apos;s so many different ways you can do this. For example, you can go to large, national general topic conferences like the Strata Data Conferences, or one of my favorites, ODSC, for the Open Data Science Conference. Both of these meet in multiple locations throughout the year. There&apos;s one that&apos;s going to be near you that you can go to. Or maybe you have a specialized topic, like, for instance, I&apos;ve gone to the Marketing Analytics and Data Science, or MADS conference, which very specifically focuses on data science within this particular marketing realm. Or where you live, you may have local events. I&apos;m in Ghana, and each year, we have the Ghana Data Science Summit, which has tracks focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. But remember, all of this, all of this is fundamentally about people and the way that you can both better understand the people and the world around you, and turn that understanding into something of value for the people you work with. So, thanks for reading this article, and good luck in the great things that you&apos;ll accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introduction to data science]]></title><description><![CDATA[There are so  much information out there on data science and analytics career paths, however, there is very little in terms of how you can get started with your first step.

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought about how data science started? Are you familiar with data science and analytics terms? Do you know what are the enabling technologies driving innovations in data science and analytics fields? If any of your answers to these questions is no, then you&apos;ve come to the right place. Before embarking on your journey in data science and analytics, it is important to know its terrain and to get acclimated as best as you can. This way, you will have a soft landing when it&apos;s time to make your decisions and seriously pursue your career in data science and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of data science coincides with the wide adoption of computers. The discipline of statistics existed well before computer science, but computers empowered statisticians to solve a wide variety of practical problems with real life implications, since heavy number crunching and massive storage of data became feasible due to the emergence of modern computing technologies. The invention of database management systems in the 1960s, and relational database management systems in the 1970s, accelerated the pace of this marriage between statistics and computer science. In the late 1980s, terms such as knowledge discovery and data mining started being used widely. In the early 1990s, database industry practitioners started noticing the explosion of business data in the form of big data. The official start of using the phrase big data can be traced back to an article published in the ACM Digital Library in 1997. In the late 1990s, the phrase data science first appeared to inspire researchers and professionals to harness the predictive power of data by effectively analyzing them and producing useful intelligence. At about the same time, the word statistician began to be used interchangeably with the term data scientist. In the mid 2000s, the word analytics was adopted by data scientists to emphasize the fact that an increasing number of companies started to heavily rely on the statistical and quantitative analysis of data, as well as predictive modeling to make informed decisions so that they can compete better with other businesses. As you can see, the history of data science is that of endless scientific and technological innovations to cope with newly emerging challenges, as we move into the era of information age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science is a highly comprehensive term that encompasses a multitude of disciplines and concepts including big data, machine learning, data mining and data analytics. Big data is especially relevant to data science these days. Think of the sheer amount of data becoming available to various organizations and individuals today. As a result of this trend, data science has to increasingly deal with big data. Essentially big data refers to a data set whose nature including its volume, variety, and velocity defies the conventional ways of processing and requires extraordinary treatment. Therefore, big data is a relative term. It is a moving target. One terabyte may be considered to be big today, but it may not be anymore in the near future as the storage and processing technologies become cheaper and faster. Machine learning frees humans from doing the mundane tasks of trying numerous possibilities of solving a problem to isolate the best solution. The relevance of machine learning and data science stems from the fact that humans are not good at repetitive work and bound to make mistakes when it comes to handling data. This is especially true when the repetition is driven by the size, complexity, and speed of the data as in the case of big data. Due to its large scale, to obtain any meaningful insight from big data, data science today can no longer rely on humans, but beginning to depend heavily on algorithms that in turn drive computers, hence the name machine learning. Data mining is one of the aspects of data science. It is a process of discovering a pattern in a data set. In the beginning of a mining process, you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re looking for. You employ various algorithms, such as those used in machine learning, to unearth a previously unknown pattern or relationship. Therefore, data mining uses machine learning as a tool in its search for new knowledge without any preconceived notions or hypotheses. The data set being used for data mining often reaches the realm of big data. Unlike data mining, data analytics starts with a specific hypothesis. That is, its purpose is testing the hypothesis. For example, the hypotheses used by data analytics could be something like social media content such as Tweets can predict the risk of a heart disease for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data analytics leverages distributed computing technologies and data analytics techniques to overcome computational challenges presented by big data sets. Distributed computing means an approach used in computer science to break down a task into smaller pieces that are easier to process. &quot;Divide and conquer&quot; is a philosophy behind this classic technique. Once partitioned into smaller chunks, each element of the task is assigned to a processor which could be geographically dispersed. For example, a fragment of your task can be processed in Accra, Ghana, while another piece can be worked on in Lagos. Cloud computing provides a platform on which distributed computing can be implemented with low cost and scalable methods. To simply put it, cloud computing offers a bunch of computers housed in data centers. In addition to the hardware, a software solution is necessary to manage various aspects of distributed computing. This is why we need software tools such as Hadoop and NoSQL databases. Once you get with both hardware and software infrastructures to store, manage, and process big data sets, you&apos;re finally ready to run data analytics programs to ask your specific questions on certain big data sets. These questions can touch on applications like fraud detection, online dating, network security, disease control, and climate changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of underlying technologies that make data science a reality. These include data infrastructure, data management, and visualization technologies. Data infrastructure technologies support how data is shared, processed and consumed. One of the most popular data infrastructure technologies data scientists use today is distributed computing in general and in particular cloud computing. There are key underlying technologies that enable cloud computing. Virtualization is one of them, distributed file sharing is another. In particular, redundant array of independent disks or RAID and Hadoop distributed file system or HDFS are prominent ones. Data Management is handled by database management systems or DBMS. Data Science requires highly scalable, reliable, and efficient ways to store, manage, and process data. Which is why DBMS plays a critical role in data science. As big data becomes mainstream, unstructured data is also becoming more prevalent. In fact, the majority of business related data is unstructured. It consists of word processing, presentation, log files, and so on. However, a significant portion of our data is still stored in conventional relational DBMS and in a structured data format. As a result, the new generation of data science professionals have to be versatile enough to be able to deal with both unstructured and structured data sets. Knowledge in SQL is still invaluable in the context of data management. Once data analysis is over, the newly acquired insight needs to be conveyed to the leadership and the rest of an organization. No matter how significant the discoveries are, if data scientists fail to communicate them effectively, especially in the context of strategic goals of the organization, their impact will be minimal. This completely beats the purpose of various data science efforts made in support of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science knowledge is quickly becoming an underlying skill many companies seek in their employees regardless of their fields. In case you are wondering why, it&apos;s time for you to understand why data science plays a critical role in tackling many of everyday business challenges out there. Fraud detection is a prime example. Take PayPal. It is leveraging machine learning to combat fraudulent transactions according to Dr. Hui Wang, senior director of Risk Sciences for PayPal. Social media analytics is another example. IBM has a product called Personality Insight. You can type in a text and their tool can analyze your personality, as you can see in this demo. Dating services are also starting to use more sophisticated form of data science. For example, Johnathon Mora, eHarmony&apos;s director of data science, spoke at the Predictive Analytics Innovation Summit in 2016, and described how his company and others are using data to enhance their customers&apos; experience. Are you now ready to learn more about how data science is used in various marketplaces? I&apos;m thrilled to talk about this topic and share my insight with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science marketplace is diverse. For example, one of its key markets is fraud detection. As we move toward the digital economy, criminals and crooks are finding various and ingenious ways to commit fraud against the banking sector. The stakes are high. The loss due to unauthorized credit card transactions alone is estimated to be billions of dollars each year. Therefore, banks are extremely interested in figuring out what&apos;s fraudulent and what&apos;s not as fast as possible or as they occur. Until very recently, fraud detection involved significant human intervention. Suspicious activities would be flagged for additional scrutiny. Then a fraud detection specialist looked into the case more closely. One of the major challenges in this approach has been the number of false positives, that is, there tend to be too many cases for a human operator to review, and a significant number of them turn out to be normal transactions anyway. Therefore, improving the accuracy of fraud detection is a key to success in this case. Machine learning and big data analytics are revolutionizing the fraud detection market by drastically reducing the number of legitimate customer events falsely identified as fraud attempts. What machine learning brings to the table is its ability to learn on its own what&apos;s the best way to detect a fraud through numerous trial and error. Big data contributes to this process by providing rich data sets machine learning algorithms can use to train themselves. The more data points there are, the more accurate the outcome becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more people are using social media. This in turn generates an enormous amount of data. Data scientists are naturally attracted to these newly emerging types of data sets. Social media refers to websites where users can post their own content to share it with their friends and beyond. Depending on their focus, social media sites have different types of interests they promote. For example, Facebook offers a forum for building informal and personal relationships, compared to a professional networking tool like LinkedIn. In addition to its size qualifying as big data, another unique value of social media data lies in the data about data, or metadata, it carries. For example, a post on Facebook can accompany location information as well as timestamps. With this kind of unstructured but very rich data sets, a lot of useful insight can be derived about a person who is posting and consuming information. For example, IBM has a product called Personality Insights which offers a profiling service for companies that would like to know more about their customers. In the case of social media analytics, text mining and parsing are the very important and necessary first step. Social media companies often make their content available through their application programming interface, or API. Using this API, data scientists can retrieve the data they want. Collecting the social media data is one thing, but manipulating it for analysis purposes is another. A lot of skills and efforts are necessary before attempting to apply analytics methods, although standards like JSON helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the areas of social media analytics applications is disease control. University of Pennsylvania conducted a study on a predictive relationship between Twitter post content and heart disease. Emotional factors are linked to heart disease. The University of Pennsylvania study identified indicators of emotional distress expressed in words and correlated them to the occurrences of heart disease. Their study used linguistic analysis techniques as well as various big data analytics techniques to reveal key words of emotion such as hate to be strongly correlated to the incidence of heart disease. On the other hand, positive words like wonderful showed the opposite correlation. The Twitter data they collected consisted of tweets posted by 88 percent of the people from countries in 2009 and 2010. This ample data set provided much stronger evidence of correlation than what they could provide through conventional surveys of subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, it is commonplace for people to find their love online. There are a number of online dating services available today. To name a few, eHarmony, Match.com, and OkCupid are those. There are various methods used by these companies to find the right matches for clients seeking their love. For instance, some online dating services use a match percentage to decide on how similar two individuals are. The match percentage is typically calculated by the similarities found between answers to a questionnaire. The answers to the questions are weighted depending on their importance. For example, a question on the level of education is more highly weighted than those on music preference. Other online dating services use a more sophisticated method, such as a compatibility predicted model. The leaders of online dating providers are now starting to adopt big data analytics to enhance the quality of their services. Match.com has collected more than 70 terabytes of data on their customers. According to Match.com, big data analytics allowed them to create 500,000 relationships, which, in turn, resulted in 92,000 marriages and 1 million babies. The primary method used by the big data analytics algorithms when making matches is to keep track of candidates&apos; online behavior. One caveat in this case is the possibility of people fabricating their online behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulations imitates the operative of a real world system. The true power of simulation comes from its predictive nature. A computer simulation can completely rely on a mathematical model, can be interpreted into an algorithm, and then finally implemented into a piece of code. A physics engine used for gaming, is an excellent example of this. This purely model-driven simulation is not always accurate and can misrepresent what can happen in the real world. Which is why data science can play an important role in simulations. By feeding real life data into a simulation model, scientists can improve the accuracy of a simulation drastically. In addition to the improved accuracy, the simulation model aided by this infusion of a large amount of real-life data can also significantly enhance its predictive power. For example, the field of Climatology is one of the beneficiaries of the recent progresses of big data analytics. Now, meteorologists can predict future weather patterns with much more accuracy. In fact, it is becoming quite feasible to predict your weather with 95% accuracy 48 hours ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the areas where simulations can be used is predictive modeling, powered by data science. Among its many applications, climate and ecosystem change predictions stand out as one of the most timely and significant way of harnessing the power of data science. For example, there is the United Nations initiative called Data for Climate Action Challenge. It&apos;s a competition aimed at encouraging climate and data scientists to develop innovative climate change research projects, by leveraging data analytics. Going a little further, now it&apos;s no longer a pipe dream to simulate the entire ecosystem of the Earth. The Madingley Model project, sponsored by Microsoft, is making this dream a reality. Using the Madingley Model, scientists can simulate the impact of climate changes on all lifeforms on Earth. The data fed into these predictive models of climate changes and ecosystems include environmental data reported through social media and sensor readings coming from various Internet of Things, or IoT devices, as well as conventional climate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cyber threats increase, more organizations are making network security as their top priority. The attacks on the internet are getting more sophisticated at light speed while network security vendors are always trying to catch up with the advances made in new hacking techniques. Despite many recent stories of network vulnerabilities being breached, it is an encouraging sign that many of the network security solutions providers are now moving towards leveraging machine learning and big data analytics to enhance their products. One of the frontiers of network security is the field of logging and monitoring. Many of the software companies offering network security solutions are incorporating machine learning and big data analytics into their product line. Microsoft is a great example of this trend. Through their cloud product called Azure, they offer a machine learning service on which users can build their own intrusion detection solutions or use any of the built-in services provided by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering about what skills you need to be successful in data science and analytics careers. Although there are boundless possibilities that could positively affect your request for landing a data science and analytics job it helps to start with some obvious ones such as data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, statistics, and visualization. Data mining is a broad term referring to the practice of examining a large amount of data for the purpose of finding meaningful patterns and establishing significant relationships to help solve a problem. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. It focuses on optimizing ways to use algorithms to conduct data analysis and analytics tasks with as little human supervision as possible. Natural language processing allows a computer to make sense of its interactions with human beings through linguistic means, such as spoken and written languages. Statistics is a foundation for data analysis and analytics in general. Without statistics it is impossible to do any sophisticated data processing like data mining or machine learning. Visualization is usually the last step of data science and analytics projects. The goal here is to communicate the results of analysis or analytics in the most intuitive way so that our stakeholders can quickly get the gist of the meaning and significance of the report. All these skills are essential in becoming a well-rounded data scientist. And a typical data science and analytics education program touches upon all of these areas. Dr. Abhijit is Professor of Practice of Computer Science at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, and the director of the Data Science Masters Degree program. Dr. Dutt calls these skills pillars of data science and analytics. As you can see becoming a data scientist demands a lot of your efforts which is why the job is so valued and sought out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data mining and analytics involve a myriad of data manipulation techniques. Text retrieval is one of the most well-known data mining techniques. It builds on many foundational concepts and methods developed by Natural Language Processing, or NLP. Classification constructs a model that labels a group of data objects into a specific category. In the classification model, the classes with their own labels are discrete in nature. For instance, the same classification model can categorize people into groups of trustworthy and untrustworthy users of an online banking system. Prediction builds a model that produces continuous or ordered values that form a trend. For instance, a prediction model can provide estimated mean time to failure or MTTF values for a computer. Clustering is a process of grouping similar data objects into a class. Clustering helps reveal features that distinguish one class of data objects from the other, leading to new discoveries on a dataset. Uses of clustering analysis range from pattern recognition and image processing to market research. For example, clustering can reveal people of similar purchasing behaviors. As you might have noticed already, the difference between classification and clustering is that classification starts with predefined labels while the labels are created after the fact for clustering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is based on self-learning or self-improving algorithms. In machine learning, a computer starts with a model, and continues to enhance it through trial and error. It can then provide meaningful insight in the form of classification, prediction, and clustering. There are two types of machine learning. One is supervised and the other is unsupervised. Supervised learning is reinforced by feedback in the form of training data. Suppose that you have a basket of apples and oranges, you&apos;d like to separate them into two distinct groups of fruits. There is apples and oranges. In the supervised learning environment, you already have training data which can tell your machine learning algorithm what fruit belongs to which group after it makes its decision. In this scenario the algorithm already knows that there are two labels to be used in its attempts to separate the fruits. Therefore, this process is accumulative classification, a concept used in the data mining and analytics domain. In the unsupervised learning environment, there is no training data. In this case the machine learning algorithm solely depends on clustering and keep enhancing its algorithm without external feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural Language Processing, or NLP, refers to a collection of different ways for a computer to make sense out of its interactions with a human being through a natural language. NLP is a comprehensive discipline in computer science and involves topics such as artificial intelligence, computer linguistics, and human computer interaction, or HCI. There are NLP subfields that are particularly relevant to a data scientist. Tokenization, parsing, sentence segmentation, and named entity recognition are some of them. Tokenization and parsing isolate each text symbol from a text and conduct a grammatical analysis. Sentence segmentation separates one sentence from the other in a text. Named entity recognition identifies which text symbol maps to what types of proper names. A significant portion of data you&apos;re dealing with as a data scientist is unstructured. That is, they are text extracted not from a database, but from sources such as social media sites, text documents, pictures, and so on. Therefore, one of the biggest challenges of a data scientist is to sort through this unstructured data and pre-process it so that data mining and analytics tools can take over to extract the ultimate knowledge they are seeking. Luckily for the data scientists, there are already well-developed NLP tools patched into program languages such as Python. Some of these tools are also built into an operating system such as Unix or Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics lays a foundation for data science. In fact, statistics is where data science started. Therefore, developing a reasonable understanding of statistics is a must for a data scientist. In fact, the more you know about statistics, the better. At a minimum, a data scientist needs to be proficient with concepts such as probability, correlation, variables, distributions, regression, null hypothesis significance tests, confidence intervals, t-test, ANOVA and chi-square. You also need to know how to use common statistical analysis tools, including R, Excel and SAS. At a more advanced level a data scientist needs to be familiar with concepts and algorithms, like logistic regression, support vector machines, or SVMs, and Bayesian methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome the challenge of effectively communicating the results of data analytics to a lay audience, there are scientists frequently rely on visualization. Therefore, it is to their scientists advantage to have a good understanding of effective visualization techniques, so that they can use the most effective one for a given problem and audience. Some of the well-known characteristics of effective visualization are readily available. These include displaying data at multiple levels of details, and avoiding distorting the message to be conveyed while attempting to visualize it. It is also very helpful to know how to use some of the software tools offered by the industry leaders of visualization solutions. For example, Tableau offers one of the most popular and comprehensive visualization tools for data scientists. It supports a variety of visualization elements such as different types of charts, graphs, maps, and other more advanced options. Always remember that your job as a data scientist is that of a middle man interfacing with both experts working with sophisticated technologies. And non-experts who don&apos;t have the luxury of wading through mountains of information to get the message they want to hear and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of opportunities you can take advantage of to play an active role and contribute to data science and analytics fields. To name just a few, there are job titles such as data scientist, data engineer, business intelligence architect, machine learning specialist, data analytics specialist, and data visualization developer. Each of these roles are critical in effectively leveraging data and its potential despite numerous challenges. For example, big data requires special processing by data engineers before an analytics specialist can even try to do their job. Take network security. Let&apos;s assume that you need to analyze a terabyte of data every day. The goal here is detecting suspicious behavior. There are numerous roles involved in this including domain experts, such as cyber security professionals, data base administrators, cloud and distributed computing specialists, network engineers, software engineers, and last but not least, data scientists. The list goes on and on. In fact, you can see this in action in my recent course on data driven network security essentials. Based on my experience working as a network management software architect for Sprint in the U.S. I can share some good stories about this from the trenches. I can definitely attest that it does take a village to get anything accomplished in the data science and analytics business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data science is an all-encompassing term. Similarly, data scientist is also an all-encompassing job title. Data is everywhere and its volume is also ever increasing. Every organization can benefit from hiring a person who can provide data analysis and analytics to reflect on its past performances and to attempt to predict its future. However, not every company can afford to hire a person whose job is dedicated to working on corporate data. Not to mention, hiring multiple experts specializing in different aspects of data science. The role of a data scientist is that of a generalist instead of a specialist. In an environment where a data scientist works with other data science specialists, such as a machine learning scientist, the data scientist can act as a liaison between the leadership of the company and the data science specialists. Therefore, one of the hallmarks of a competent data scientist is an ability to communicate effectively. Compared to other highly specialized jobs in data science, the entrance barrier to a data science job is relatively lower. A solid training in computer science or statistics, may be enough for you to get started at an entry-level position. But a Master&apos;s degree in data science is a big plus. In this case, what&apos;s more important is your passion for data. Also, a potential for job growth is very high as you become a seasoned data scientist and take on various leadership positions in a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Intelligence, or BI, is a process of collecting, managing and processing corporate data to provide actionable information for the leadership and employees of a company. BI is heavily technology-driven, and leverages various software applications to perform the analyses and analytics of company data. In the information technology industry, the architect job title is often given to a senior member of a technical team, such as group of software developers. An architect is usually a person who is at the pinnacle of a technical career. This person is a seasoned veteran who leads a major technology initiatives of a company. Therefore, an architect position is by no means considered to be an entry level position in most companies. With this understanding of what is BI and what it means to be an architect, let&apos;s explore more the job of BI architect. One of the core responsibilities of a BI architect is to design and implement system architectures to maximize the potential of a company&apos;s data assets. To make this happen, the BI architect needs to be able to build a system that links various standalone IT systems throughout a company to pool relevant and useful information for strategic decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualified machine learning scientists are sought after and their salaries are also climbing up. At the top of their career, machine learning scientists program computers to learn on their own. So then more specifically what is required of a machine learning scientist? At its highest level the job requires you to be highly creative and independent. Nobody can tell you what to do when your job is to enhance customer interactions at a multi-billion dollar company through machine learning techniques. You also need the discipline to follow through and meet deadlines. Finally, attention to details and quality is critical. As small, seemingly insignificant mistake can cause a havoc on your entire project when you have to deal with millions of unhappy customers. Now let&apos;s talk about technical skills. The most foundational ones are usual suspects required for any advanced IT professions. Math skills are essential because they form the foundations of the technical language machine learning scientists use. In particular, deep knowledge of statistics and probability is important. Next is an ability to develop and validate a mathematical model representing various aspects of machine learning. Once a model is developed, it needs to be translated into an algorithm or unambiguous and discrete processes computer can execute. Finally, you also need some practical IT skills. Proficiency in programming languages, such as Python, C++, Java and R is very helpful. Your work efficiency as a machine learning scientist is often dependent upon your ability to preprocess a large amount of text very quickly and efficiently. Therefore, your familiarity with Unix Linux tools like sed, awk, grep, find, and sort is highly useful. Last but not least is your understanding of distributed computing because your machine learning program will most probably have to take advantage of technologies such as Hadoop and cloud computing. As we can store data more cheaply and easily, there is an increasing number of data sources available to us. These include images, videos, maps, networking data, social media data and so on. Therefore, naturally there is a growing need for data processing. Machine learning scientists are at the forefront of this kind of efforts for leveraging the data around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word business strongly implies a requirement for solid business knowledge and sense for this job. Therefore, whoever is aspiring to become a business analytics specialist, must be both business and technology savvy. Business analytics specialist are those who make things happen under the overarching vision of the architect. In other words, they implement BI architectures according to the direction and supervision of the BI architect. When a company can&apos;t afford to hire a BI architect, it needs to march on by solely relying on a business analytics specialist to obtain its BI. This also means that they cannot architect and build their own BI systems due to the lack of resources. Naturally, in this scenario, the business analytics specialist has no other choice but to depend on off the shelf software products offering business analytics capabilities. Luckily for these smaller companies with less resources, the service of business analytics is being quickly commoditized and becoming easily accessible. The quality and ease of use of these products are also improving very rapidly. For example, Amazon has a service called QuickSight. According to their marketing literature it is a very fast, easy to use, cloud-powered business intelligence for 1/10th the cost of traditional BI solutions. This kind of product is a perfect tool for a business analytics specialist to take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data visualization is also industry neutral. That is, data visualization developer can work in any industries because their skills are applicable to wherever data is being used. For example, there are a lot of research and development organizations out there including companies specializing in visualization seeking new innovative ways to visualize data. Media companies such as news outlets are also hiring visualization developers. They need infographics to draw attention from their readers and viewers. Of course any data analytics groups in industry and academia would like to hire their own data visualization developers. Although working independently at times, data visualization developers are expected to frequently work with various teams of people dealing with different aspects of data science. For instance there will be working very closely with data scientists, business intelligence architects, machine learning specialists, and business analytics specialists on a daily basis. Their primary job is to work collaboratively to identify the most appealing and effective means to visually express data mining and analytics results to help develop new insight and to assist in making critical business decisions. Since it is a development position, this job requires programming skills especially in the area of web development and other Graphical User Interface platforms. Also a visualization specialist must have knowledge in various database systems and query languages because part of their job is to interface with the database APIs to pull the data before it gets displayed. Finally, they need to be proficient with mainstream data visualization software tools so that they can speed up their development. After hearing about what it takes to be a data visualization developer, are you interested in pursuing this career path? I believe this job is for you if you&apos;re a creative and artistic kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you guess how much data science and analytics professionals are making on the average in terms of their annual salary? Of course the salary numbers are always changing, and a lot depends on where you are working due to the cost of living differences. The good news is that the sky&apos;s the limit. Data science and analytics professionals are at a high demand. Therefore your salary potential will be higher than or comparable to that of other high demand IT professionals, such as cyber security experts. Because I know how difficult it is to nail down salary statistics due to its diverse and fluctuating nature let me give you some anecdotal snapshots of how well specific types of data science and analytics professionals are getting paid. For example, according to payscale.com, entry level data scientists receive above $80,000 per year. Mid-level data scientists make around 120k, while senior data scientists bring home close to 150k. The bottom line here is that the salary prospects of data science and analytics professionals are excellent. You&apos;re at the right place and at the right time to start your career as a data science and analytics professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the field of data science and analytics matures, we&apos;re seeing more certification opportunities becoming available. Just like any professionals out there, data scientists can establish more credibility in what they&apos;re capable of by earning well-known certifications in their field. There are myriads of certification opportunities available, and the number is growing as we speak. The key here is not how many certifications you have but how many relevant skills you can demonstrate through the certifications you have. Many of the certifications also require significant industry experience, therefore, it is important for you to pick and choose the best ones that fit your own needs. If you&apos;re a student who is about to graduate, your best bet would be certifications that do not require any experience in the industry. For example, the Certified Analytics Professional certification allows an associate CAP option so that students can pass the exam portion of the certification requirements without any industry experience and get fully certified once they obtain enough industry experience. If you&apos;re a working industry professional who is interested in enhancing your marketability, a more specialized form of certification may be appropriate. These can be directly tied to software products you&apos;re required to use on a daily basis, and include certifications such as MCSE Business Intelligence, Cloudera Certified Professional, EMC Data Science Associate, Oracle BI Implementation Specialist, and SAS Certified Data Scientist certifications. To share an industry perspective, having certifications is definitely a plus, because it proves a candidate&apos;s proficiency in a specific area of knowledge domain or software tools. But certainly you want to be strategic about what certification you pursue, because it can be a very expensive and time-consuming endeavor. The key here is to pair a certification with your experience and further strengthen your credentials. I&apos;m hoping that I can shed some light on this topic by going over several well-known certifications in data science and analytics with you. You&apos;ll be amazed and pleasantly surprised by the diversity and depth of what&apos;s already available out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of data science is very bright. There are new technological breakthroughs happening almost daily, and this trend will only accelerate. To be better prepared for what the future will bring us, it is critical for us to review representative emerging technologies in data science and analytics. These emerging technologies will, in turn, create new job opportunities. Therefore, if you can understand the technology trends well, and use it to focus your education and training, you will be better positioned in taking advantage of the new career options resulting from the advances in technologies. As you gain more capabilities as a data science and analytics expert, you will feel more empowered, and maybe tempted to abuse your power. We see this happening all the time. It is very easy to manipulate your data and tell an entirely different story, which is why you need to seriously consider the ethical aspect of your job as a data science and analytics professional. Finally, due to the technology driven nature of data science and analytics fields, your knowledge can become very quickly obsolete if you&apos;re not careful. This is why you need to constantly update and upgrade your knowledge, especially in this field, through continuing professional development. If you have a curious mind, you will find the profession of data science and analytics fascinating and fulfilling. After all, the job never gets boring, but you will also have to make sure that you keep up with it. Let&apos;s find out how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like many other technology fields, the discipline of data science is dynamic and constantly changing. Therefore, it is a must for a data scientist to keep refreshing their knowledge to stay relevant. One of the prominent new trends is the convergence among cloud computing, big data analytics, and machine learning. In fact, it&apos;s no longer necessary to provision private resources housed in your own organization to deploy a distributed computing solution like Hadoop. Various online retail data services, including warehouses, mining, and analytics, are already available in the cloud through vendors like Amazon, IBM, Google, and so on. This makes it cheaper for companies to use data science techniques to solve their business problems, which in turn increases the demand for data scientists. Some other salient features, making these cloud-based data science services more attractive, are their scalability and ease of use. The majority of data scientists no longer have to worry about data infrastructure and management problems due to these emerging online data science services. In conjunction with the consolidation between cloud computing and big data analytics, the importance of machine learning as the critical part of the data science equation is also rapidly growing. Especially deep learning hinging on a set of machine learning algorithms taking advantage of neural networking is getting more traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s no doubt that data science careers are trending upwards. In fact, many industry watchers are reporting shortages in qualified professionals for the foreseeable future. Therefore, I&apos;m happy to say that the outlook for data science job opportunities is extremely bright. Now, the challenge is to prepare yourself for these wonderful opportunities. A good starting point is to develop passion for data science by first getting exposed to the field as much as you can. Once you know you&apos;re ready for the task of diving into your journey of training and educating yourself on data science, the next big step to take is to actually commit yourself to lifelong learning. Identify a degree program or online curriculum that will provide a roadmap to your ultimate goal of becoming a data scientist, and simply plunge into it. If you need more guidance, find a mentor who could coach you along the way. This could be your professor, colleague, or someone you get to know through a LinkedIn invitation. All the careers in data science are fairly new still emerging and evolving. These careers include job titles such as Data scientist, Business intelligence architect, Machine learning specialist, Business analytics specialist, Data visualization developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threats are everywhere, in fact, we hear about new data breeches all the time. Sometimes, these security incidents are insider jobs, disgruntled employees, or industrial spies maybe lurking around you. You yourself may be tempted to eavesdrop on your coworkers or supervisor&apos;s data, just out of curiosity. As a result, the ethical integrity of a data scientist can make up a huge difference in guarding the security and privacy of user data. In addition to watching out for an insider threat and keeping yourself out of the danger zone, it is also an ethical thing to intentionally and proactively build in security into a data science product you are developing. If you don&apos;t do your job as a data scientist to ensure the security and privacy of your customer data, somebody is bound to fall victim to a crime down the road. It is often the case that security is a second thought when working on a data science project. Time to market pressure seems to be always winning. However, many organizations are realizing that, considering security and privacy risks, and their countermeasures from the very beginning of a data science project can ultimately save all the troubles of legal, monetary, and reputational liabilities. The data science code of ethics is still being formed, as the profession of data scientist keeps evolving. As the profession matures, you need to be constantly reminding yourself of all the basic elements of ethical conducts as a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data scientists need to stay abreast of new developments in both their specialty and discipline, at large, as well as the overall IT world. The breadth of the knowledge requirements for them is quite wide because data science builds on many of its underlying IT technologies, such as data infrastructure, and management. For example, one of the emerging data science technologies is in-memory analytics. Which means, running entire data analytics operations in the main memory of a computer instead of reading some of the data back and forth, from a secondary memory device. Such as an external storage device. As a data scientist, you need to know the implications of this relatively new technology in your job, on a daily basis, and make a decision on whether to adopt it now or later. As you may already be well aware there are a number of ways to keep current with the latest developments in your field of expertise. One of the ways to force yourself to do this is to get certified. After getting your certification, such as certified analytics professional, or CAP, you need to get recertified by acquiring a certain number of professional development units or PDUs, every once in awhile. Networking with other data science professionals by participating in conferences and workshops is another great way of keeping up to date with your profession. After all, these activities are what makes your job more exciting and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn works best when you realize that its a tool that most Recruiters, Talent Acquisition and HR Personnel use to find and recruit new potential employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not be aware but Recruiters have a different view on LinkedIn, this is by design to allow them to parse, narrow and target specific people based on the information provided. For recruiters it starts at this screen. Where they start the search off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The searches usually begin with Profile Job title, Location and a few different skills. The first opportunity you have to improve your profile&apos;s visibility and show up on a Recruiter&apos;s search is to put the Job title you have/want in your Headline caption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re open to relocating, in addition to selecting the options through LinkedIn&apos;s drop down menu Put in the BODY of your profile the words OPEN TO RELOCATING TO and list the cities/countries you&apos;re willing to move to and what your employment status is (International only)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial search screen, Recruiters are greeted by a LinkedIn screen that gives them a comprehensive view of candidates that most likely fit that search criteria. As you can see the tabs at the top Enables Recruiters to see Who is open to opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you been excitedly sending out your polished resume and cover letter, but are disappointed with the response rate? Maybe you have sent out over 100 applications but you have only received automated rejection emails? Unfortunately, this scenario is all too common, but it’s easily remedied by using the cold email strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason you aren’t getting any responses is that your application is being weeded out by a recruiter. Embrace the art of cold emailing and avoid HR and recruiters altogether. Stop waiting in line at the front door with everyone else, go directly to the back door and knock! By reaching out to a potential teammate or hiring manager, you are automatically bypassing the first screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as simple as this: After applying to a job, find the hiring manager or a potential teammate for the position, then send them a direct email with an informative blurb about yourself and how you would add value to the team. Your goal is to get them on the phone to talk about the position. This individual will be evaluating you as a whole person, and not just another application that either checks the boxes or not. Now someone on the actual team is considering whether you would be a good fit. If they respond to your email, congratulations - you have just received your first interview!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a recruiter, you are an application. To an engineer, you are a potential teammate. Recruiters are looking for candidates with very specific criteria that were given to them by the hiring manager. A recruiter is restricted to the list of criteria that the hiring manager gives them, effectively rejecting many qualified job seekers who do not check all the boxes that would otherwise make a good employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you do find yourself working with a recruiter, be sure to clearly articulate your value to them, so they can consider you as a candidate even if you don’t “check all of the boxes” on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know cold emails are effective, let’s talk about how to do it. Remember, when looking for a job, you are trying to connect with people rather than trying to impress them. Just remember, a human being is hiring you, not a machine. Follow the steps below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you apply for a job, find someone who works at the company. This person should either be a potential peer or supervisor, not a recruiter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find their email using services like: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hunter.io/&quot;&gt;https://hunter.io/&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://findthat.email/&quot;&gt;http://findthat.email/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send an email like the one below describing the value you can add, and make a request to talk to them on the phone about the position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Hi {First name},

I hope this email finds you well. I recently came across the {Position Name} role at {Company name} and would like to discuss the opportunity with someone on the team. I reached out to you because of {something in common with the person. Your goal is to connect with the reader in the first paragraph}.

As I detail below, {short summary of the value you can add, you’ll expand on this below} makes me a great candidate for this position:

1. {Skill or experience, with a brief story or metric to back up your claim} Example: I have three years of experience working at a large software company with a complex codebase where I worked with engineers to develop new features.

2. I have built {Technical project you have built} {languages/frameworks used to build project} Example: I have built frontend apps using React/Redux and know Javascript well.

3. another bullet point the same as the ones above about how you would add value}

{1 - 2 sentences about why you are excited about this opportunity and re-emphasizing why you would be a good fit}

Thank you for taking the time to review my email. 

I was wondering if you would be open to a 10-minute chat on the phone? I know this might be a busy time for you, so if I don’t hear back I will follow up in a week.

Thanks,

 

{your name}

{personal website} - {your Github} - {LinkedIn}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn Method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send a LinkedIn connection request with a note. The note should say something like: Hi [NAME], I just applied to the [JOB TITLE] at [COMPANY] and would love to chat with someone about the position. [ONE SENTENCE BRIEFLY DESCRIBING THE VALUE YOU CAN ADD]. Hoping to connect, thanks! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once they (hopefully) accept your LinkedIn Connection request, send the same type of email as Step 3 above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always make sure your email allows people to easily learn more about you. You should always include links to things you are talking about in the email. Don’t get too caught up with the templates. Experiment with your emails and find what works with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon graduating from a school, don’t rely on your  experience alone. You are competing for jobs with people who often have more experience than you do, so standing out is important. I highly recommend people spend just as much time cold emailing as they do applying to jobs. The people I’ve worked with who embrace this method have a significantly higher response rate than those turning in applications alone. Don’t forget, your goal is to make a connection with them as a human being, and to present how both your hard and soft skills will be an asset to their team!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Journey of a sales person part 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[Everyone who starts any venture wants to make profit.

You can only make profit when you sell enough to cover your cost of production and still have more money left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people make sales or earn revenues but do not make profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triangle of profits is basically your market, the message your market needs and the best media to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now since we have established that you can only make profits when you sell, triangle of profits will therefore focus on sales:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you sell,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to sell, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who you should sell to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something crucial before we continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me establish that marketing precedes sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sell, you have to advertise or make your potential customers know you exist and what value you will add to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing is the religion of business. A business owner who does not know how to market is like a soldier who does not know how to handle a gun. The soldier will get killed in the battlefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business is a battle front. All businesses are in marketplace to get their own share of the pie. You must therefore engage in marketing. What to spend, how to spend it and where to spend it depends on our business. I will talk about this subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Marketing is not what you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing is not a cute logo, a nice business card or some attempt at “branding” that you have no money for. Those are good but they are the ones alone bringing in sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I define marketing as the science &amp;#x26; art of engineering a process that take unknown skeptics and turning them into rabid fanatics of your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have challenges when it comes to sales. Let talk about the why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not giving the people in your target market what they want to buy. You must ask yourself if the people you plan selling to will ever want your product. People do not buy what they do not want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No amount of advertising, persuasion or mind tricks will change their mind. The market is just what it is – the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your job is not to bend the customer to your will but to bend to the will of the customer and you will get all you want to get from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling a weight loss product to overweight women – Which do you think would do better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of bench press weight lifts exercise equipment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herbal weight loss tea?
Weight loss tea of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because overweight women have specific dreams, desires, preferences, irritations and mindsets, all of which influences the choice of products the buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They hate exercising but love being lazy and chilling. Exercising is painful to them, both mentally and physically, so they avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will instead go for products with similar promise of weight loss without the pain of exercising or using the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are NOT targeting the right customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you sell children toys, you do not target everybody. You target parents who have kids. Then you narrow it down to those who care about their kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a step further and target more mothers than fathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fathers also care but mothers pay more attention to every little detail about their kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrow it further to mothers who have kids that need toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. You make selling easier and you are guaranteed more sales if you do your business like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not telling the market what they need to hear in order to buy from you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be a catch that will make them want to buy. There are different levels of buying decisions. It&apos;s called the buying cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your job is to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are looking for customers in the wrong place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to know where your potential market are and target your efforts in getting their attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising on Facebook or putting up beautiful branded posts on Instagram will not give us the sales and profits we are in business for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know where your customers are so that you will not be frustrated targeting the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not have a predictable customer journey part&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have short attention span and are distracted by too many things. There is plenty of content everywhere. A newspaper? hundreds of adverts. TV? Same. On Facebook? Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp? Everybody wants attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as soon as you get it, your job is not to lose it… and that journey part is what is called a sales funnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a farmer. Birds kept in a battery cage, pen or confined space will do better by giving more meat &amp;#x26; eggs than those left to roam everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reason is because the energy they would have burnt off roaming everywhere is conserved and applied productively to give more yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you MUST have a sales funnel if not your customers will be scattered around and you might lose them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How To Get Your Market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two markets in the world. The RICH and the MASSES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they are both subdivided into their sex, age, location, religion, race, Income, education, where they work, entertainment they like, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products sold to masses are lower profit margins with high sales volumes while for the rich is high margins and lower volume of sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classic example is Dangote Group - the masses and Apple Inc - the rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exclusive yacht club founded by Jim Ovia is a classic example. Rich people will pay premium to join as it is a way to meet and network with their kind. The VIP lounge in clubs is another example where drinks and meals are super expensive than the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presidential and Executive suites in any hotel or First class in planes falls into this category as everyone will arrive their destination at the same time but they pay more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who is your own market? Is it defined? How do you find them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do free surveys online and offline. I did for @ePoultryGH, our new agritech company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked if people would want to invest in poultry farming remotely and the risks they envisaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an online poultry class on my social media channels in January and ran it for 17 weeks to proof to the world I am a king in the poultry business. So if I slap my face on a poultry investment platform, people won&apos;t doubt our seriousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Ask questions. Check Facebook Groups where it aligns with your product. If I want to sell something targeting farmers, I would use Facebook groups that has real farmers and not relationship experts. Use Google as well and search for forums based on your niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, have a unique selling point. Basically how you promise to take them from where they are now to where they want to be. It goes beyond just selling and collecting their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTN is everywhere you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our newest business @ePoultryGH&apos;s USP is &quot;own and move your poultry farm with you in your pocket”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can own a poultry farm and move it everywhere without getting dirty while you make mouth watering profits impossible anywhere else NOW. Let’s talk. 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😁😁😁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE MESSAGE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is basically what you have to say. Here you must look for keywords that resonates with your market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a copy during Easter to sell our chickens. I was targeting the fairly educated who are on social media who know the implication of their consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with a research  on how chickens imported are preserved, what was used &amp;#x26; how it can kill. I then mentioned those it had killed via kidney diseases, regardless of their status/wealth, &amp;#x26; how dialysis cost a lot of money just because of chicken less than 200&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We normally sell one for 250 and so 3 whole chickens will be 750 but said we will give them 3 for the prize of 2 which is 550 with FREE processing and FREE delivery within Yenagoa. They jumped on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;500 was for the chicken and 500 for transport but we said it was for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gave it a specific period and ran out of stock. People are still asking for it now. When we analyzed our profits for that period, it was 53%. Say wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are looking for good deals not the cheapest prices per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, I mentioned about sales funnel earlier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now ALL the people we sold chickens too are now our egg customers. I asked for reviews from ALL of them individually, about the quality of the chicken, taste, price, delivery, packaging, and it came 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew they were excited and quickly offered to be their egg plugs. So from Chicken, they will go for eggs. Since they are satisfied and they now have my confidence, I will soon offer them another chicken combo we are planning. Then another one that will come after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting customers is tough. The ones you get, keep them and milk them properly not by cheating them but by offering them more value for more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE MEDIA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply the medium or channels you use to communicate your message to the market. This is largely determined by your target market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet and social media offers some of biggest, cheapest and easiest marketing channels today but not all your customers are on Facebook and Instagram.
It might be LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours could be via E-mail or Google Adwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a photographer, Instagram works better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those selling say in Yenagoa, Facebook may work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your target market are professionals, LinkedIn is your to go platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio still works. So if your audience are more of radio, do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not spend all the time, looking for a perfect sales funnel or a sales copy or strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get one apply it. If it works, fine. If it doesn’t, find out why, tweak it again and in a short time, you will smile to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many give examples of the ones they did that worked. I have failed before too. I have been broke in business. I have closed down operations for 2 months before starting again. It is not all rossy but when you get the keys and know how to SELL, you just be at PEACE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wait to have it perfect before going out, remember you are not the only business man or woman in the market place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So MOVE NOW!&lt;/p&gt;

It is the highest you have ever earned. You are elated. You accept.
I am here to tell you that you just left a lot of money on the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay fine. Let&apos;s go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always negotiate. No matter how much the pay is. This is because a company&apos;s first offer to you is hardly the highest they can offer. Most companies have a band for different levels. Try to find out what the upper limit of the band is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is, of course, different for small businesses. This thread is really focused on large to medium-sized companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have that out of the way. I&apos;ll illustrate with a real-life example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine got a job at a big company. They made an offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s call him Sam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They made Sam an offer that was amazing &amp;#x26; when he showed it to me, he was reluctant to negotiate. Because the offer was excellent on its own and he was generally uncomfortable negotiating. But I insisted. The rule is simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;never take the first offer&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we got to work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told them thanks for the offer (say $20K per annum) but told them that he is requesting for them to bump the offer to $50K. They declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me they delined. End of story right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Nope! Because declining is part of their own negotiating tactic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this point is very critical. Don’t pay attention to the decline. Pay attention to the WHY they declined. When people are negotiating they get distracted by the “no”. Frankly, the “no” is not your business. Your business is the reason behind the no. Because that’s your gold&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give a practical eg. If they decline by saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“this is the maximum we have for this level”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s okay. Then you negotiate for a level up. If a firm can offer you level 5, they can most likely offer you level 6. This is when you have leverage to make the request&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason they give you for the decline formed the basis of your response. If they do not give a reason. Always ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is now where you bring the big guns out. Lead with receipts (if you aren&apos;t keeping receipts at your present job start now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receipts are numbers &amp;#x26; facts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t start appealing to emotions. No need. Tell them nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I did/achieved in that role and that exposure will enable me to do XYZ in this role more efficiently than anyone else you have hired for this role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Employers like confident people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it is possible they actually do not have any more money to give you. Then ask for other things. A more senior title (this one is super useful for your next role), better health coverage, a promise to reopen negotiations in 6 months. Just do not accept the decline &amp;#x26; go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire thread contains the strategies we used with Sam. And not only did Sam get a pay increase, he also got a more senior role!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always negotiate. All the best.&lt;/p&gt;

You resume early, close late and even work on weekends. Things go on fine for years, till you started feeling tired all the time and even depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about burnout &amp;#x26; what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously defined only as a “state of vital exhaustion,” burnout has now been classified as a “syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO emphasizes that burnout is specifically work-related—it “should not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life&quot;. This is characterised by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sense of exhaustion/depletion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mental distance from or negativity/cynicism about work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreased effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout is when somebody just feels depleted from doing the task at hand. It happens when the demands being put upon you exceed the resources you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the tank is empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workplace burnout is more than when you&apos;ve had a bad day or a tough week— everyone experiences that from time to time. Burnout tends to be when you just don’t have any good days, and it goes on for a long period of time.
A lot of burnout really has to do with experiencing chronic stress and when left unchecked, it can wreak havoc on your health, happiness, relationships &amp;#x26; job performance. In order to catch and combat burnout early, it’s important to know what to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 10 signs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exhaustion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clear sign of burnout is when you feel tired all the time. This exhaustion can be emotional, mental or physical. It’s the sense of not having any energy, of being completely spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of Motivation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you don’t feel enthusiastic about anything anymore or you no longer have that internal motivation for your work, there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;re experiencing burnout.
This lack of motivation may also manifest in the form of a difficulty to get going in the morning or difficulty to drag yourself into work every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frustration &amp;#x26; Other Negative Emotions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happens, you may feel like what you’re doing doesn’t matter that much anymore, or you may be disillusioned with everything. You might notice that you feel more generally pessimistic than you used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While everybody experiences some negative emotions from time to time, it’s important to know when these are becoming unusual for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cognitive Problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout and chronic stress may interfere with your ability to pay attention or concentrate. When we&apos;re stressed, our attention narrows to focus on the negative element that we perceive as a threat.
In the short term, this helps us deal with the problem at hand but our bodies and brains are designed to handle this in short bursts and then return to normal functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When stress becomes chronic, this narrow focus prevents us from paying attention to other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &quot;fight or flight&quot; tunnel vision can negatively affect your ability to solve problems or make decisions. You might find that you’re more forgetful and have a harder time remembering things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slipping Job Performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure whether you&apos;re burnt out? Compare your current performance to previous years. As burnout tends to happen over a long time, this approach might reveal whether you&apos;re in a temporary slump or experiencing more chronic burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpersonal Problems at Home and at Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tends to manifest in one of two ways: (a) You’re having more conflicts with colleagues/friends/family or (b) you withdraw, talking to your coworkers and family members less. You might be there in person but tuned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not Taking Care of Yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When suffering from burnout, some people engage in unhealthy coping strategies like drinking too much, smoking, being too sedentary, eating too much junk food, not eating enough or not getting enough sleep.
Self-medication is another issue and could include relying on sleeping pills to sleep, drinking more alcohol at the end of the day to de-stress or even drinking more coffee to summon up the energy to drag yourself into work in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being Preoccupied With Work ... When You&apos;re Not at Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you might not be working at a given moment, if you’re expending mental energy mulling over your job, then your work is interfering with your ability to recover from the stresses of your day.
In order to recover, you need time to yourself after the actual task stops ... and time when you stop thinking about that task altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally Decreased Satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the tendency to feel less happy and satisfied with your career and with your home life. You might feel dissatisfied or even stuck when it comes to whatever is going on at home, in the community or with your social activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health Problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a long period of time, serious chronic stress can create real health problems like digestive issues, heart disease, depression and obesity.
So what do you do if you&apos;re experiencing any of the above burnout symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take Relaxation Seriously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you take up meditation, reading a book, taking a walk or visiting with friends and family, truly think about what you&apos;ll do to relax &amp;#x26; find time for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivate a Rich Non-Work Life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find something outside of work that you are passionate about that&apos;s relaxing, engaging and really gets you going—whether a hobby, sports or fitness activities or volunteering in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;unplug-from-digital-devices&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#unplug-from-digital-devices&quot; aria-label=&quot;unplug from digital devices permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Unplug from Digital Devices&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While communication technology can promote productivity, it can also allow work stressors seep into family time, vacation and social activities. Set boundaries by turning off cell phones at dinner and delegating certain times to check email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Enough Sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that having fewer than six hours of sleep per night is a major risk factor for burnout, not least because poor sleep can have negative effects on your job performance and productivity. Sleep deprivation can also lead to fatigue...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...decrease your motivation, make you more sensitive to stressful events, impair your mental function, leave you more susceptible to errors and make it harder to juggle competing demands. The reverse is true, too as sleep can actually improve your memory.
Recovering from chronic stress and burnout requires removing or reducing the demands on you and replenishing your resources. Sleep is one strategy for replenishing those resources. For inspiration, you can check out our tips to get better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Organized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, when people are burnt out, they spend a lot of time worrying that they’ll forget to do something or that something important is going to slip through the cracks. Get organized, clear your head, put together a to-do list and prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burn-out is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feeling exhausted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one&apos;s job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduced professional efficacy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burn-out is included in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as an occupational phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout is more likely to happen if we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&apos;t feel valued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&apos;t feel like we are making an impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have no autonomy over a situatio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout is not just physical but also mental too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways mental burnout can be far more challenging to deal with than physical burnout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compassion, kindness, authenticity, accepting others and working in each other&apos;s interests are likely to minimise stress and improve satisfaction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout can be scary. It can become distorted and magnified into an irredeemable self perception of failure particularly among the self critical among us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout can make it hard for us to see things clearly and objectively. It can feel as if there is little support on offer or very few places to turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remind yourself that this is the burnout speaking and NOT reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be really tough to know what to do if you feel burnout but just know that those around you will have likely had some feelings of burnout at some point and will understand how you feel. You are never alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start your day by relaxing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;listening to music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hearing the news&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;origami&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;candles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever works for you &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporate healthy eating, exercise and sleeping habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy eating makes a difference. Try to plan meals if possible and 5-a-day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A walk or a run or a jog can make a huge difference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to maintain great sleep hygiene. Sleep early, sleep for a good length of time &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set personal boundaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s ok to say NO to extra tasks if you feel now isn&apos;t a great time. Others will understand 😀👍😀 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a break from technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s ok to focus on the present moment rather than madness all around us. 😀 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness can really help. There are some great apps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to someone 😀👍😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s ok. Things can get better. There is hope. Believe there will be better times. Don&apos;t lose hope. There is always a solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurture your creative inclinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singing
Sports
Pick up an instrument
Origami
Arts and crafts
Painting
Drawing
Making dolls houses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take time off. If burnout seems unavoidable, it&apos;s ok to take a break and chill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each and every one of us has a duty to treat others with respect, compassion and kindness. We can all make each other feel valued. 😀👍😀 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindness breeds kindness.
Compassion breeds compassion.
Care breeds care .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best response to unkindness can be kindness. Kindness is not naivety 👏 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what to do if you recognise a colleague is experiencing burnout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;offer to chat -coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be kind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to understand their perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;genuinely aim to support them in their best interests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be someone your colleague can trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explore support options together &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can inspire others with how we choose to act and how we choose to treat others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our actions are a conscious CHOICE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OUR ACTIONS speak louder than words. We never know what challeneges others are suffering with in their own lives. So be kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not know it but YOUR act of kindness could make someone&apos;s day. For some, it might be what gets them through their day. 💓 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s worth taking time to reflect upon our own insecurities and weaknesses. It&apos;s time to be happy for others when they succeed, support them when they don&apos;t and be civil, respectful and authentic otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions DO speak louder than words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is about living, breathing every moment and being there for those who need it so that they can do the same. 😀 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others may call #kindness naivety. BUT just know that one day they will need a shoulder to cry on and once they feel that kindness has touched their heart, they will want to do the same for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindness breeds kidness.
Compassion breeds compassion 😍 .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfairness and perceived lack of justice breeds burnout. Important we are as fair and balanced as we can be in how we treat others. It&apos;s worth reflecting on our unconscious biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions speak louder than words .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think what legacy am I leaving behind here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully one of #kindness #compassion #authenticity #fairness 😍 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are looking at how we behave all the time to set their own threshold of how to act in a situation. Let&apos;s be the ones to set a threshold of #kindness #compassion #fairness #authenticity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to treat ourselves and others with #compassion #support and #understanding. 💓 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary we all have a collective responsibility to recognise when we or others around us are experiencing burnout. Burnout isn&apos;t just physical. It can be mental too. It&apos;s our duty to support each other and CHOOSE to act with #compassion #fairness #care. Let&apos;s do it. 😍 &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Interview tips for job seekers]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here are some of the CV donts, dear millennials, #CVdonts We’ve been looking for interns for a while and receiving various Cvs. I realize some of the millennials are messing up…]]></description><link>https://www.kojobartels.com//interview-tips-for-job-seekers/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.kojobartels.com//interview-tips-for-job-seekers/</guid><category><![CDATA[interview]]></category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the CV donts, dear millennials, #CVdonts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been looking for interns for a while and receiving various Cvs. I realize some of the millennials are messing up with their cv #CvDonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t put a sexy pic in your CV. Let your skills speak for you #CvDonts #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t scan your CV, sometimes it comes up cut, unclear #Cvdonts #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t just send an attachment with no background in the body of the email. Add 2 or 3 paragraphs in your email that highlight relevant qualifications and skills #Cvdonts #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expand more on your skills... daily tasks etc. eg. If you are a Journo, don’t just note, 5 years at company x, include daily duties such as photography, proofreading, blogging, managing social Med and website which may give you an advantage #Cvdonts #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always remember the person looking at your Cv might be dealing with 100s of them. You have a few secs to capture the attention. Sell yourself well in the email intro #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Cv with poor grammar and spelling problems presents you negatively. Always clean your CV up. #Jobseekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always volunteer to work for free in the area of your interest or qualification. Do not just sit at home with your qualifications #Jobseekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your social media presence is clear of posts on gender bias, racism, politics, that could present you negatively. Recruiters will always do a background check on your social media acts. #Jobseekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be careful of your social Med posts as a job seeker. Eg. Men are dogs 🐕 or women are trash 🗑 or I hated my boss may present you negatively to a potential employers #Jobseekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, don’t scan your CV. #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid making unsubstantiated claims like a hard worker, dedicated, smart etc. That does not distinguish you at all. Go straight to why we should hire you. Perhaps say I’m a hard worker: eg, I finished my degree in record time, I study and work at the same time #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good Cv does not mean anything if on your social media you present yourself otherwise. It always helps to not appear a drunkard, reckless, on your social Media if you are job hunting #Jobseekers
I repeat this point: always volunteer whilst a student in your field of study or otherwise to gain some experience. It goes a long way. #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are studying PR/Communications, Media... try acquire skills in writing, social media management and website management. This will give you an advantage. Most recruiters bundle these roles into one position. #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every work related achievement must go on to the Cv, not on social media, lol. #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do get an interview : don’t answer the question how much would you like to earn with a figure. Rather say I would welcome a market related offer or give a fair annual bracket market related #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an interviewers says tell us about yourself is no chance for you to dwell on names and how many kids you got or where you come from. Go straight to selling yourself. What are your relevant qualifications to the post, skills that distinguish you. Sell sell sell. #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never talk badly about your former boss or company. Rather say reason for leaving was coz you were looking for a change in career direction etc #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do get an interview and you are asked “ why should we hire you” don’t say ... I’m a hard worker, dedicated, etc. those are unsubstantiated claims. Rather give examples proving hard work. Eg, I completed a 6 months project in 3 months etc #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are asked in an interview what are your weaknesses, this is no chance for you to list the negative habits about yourself. Rather turn a weakness into a strength, eg, I’m a perfectionist. This, I work a lot harder to get things, even simple things done #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dress for your next job #JobSeekers&lt;/p&gt;

Don’t give your personal or employment history. Instead give a compelling pitch that shows why you’re fit for the job. Start with 2-3 relevant experiences then wrap up talking about how that prior experience has positioned you for this role.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership is the ability to rally people not for a single event,but for year. In business,leadership means that customers will continue to support your company even when you slip up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great leaders, in contrast, are able to inspire people to act. Those who are able to inspire give people a sense of purpose or belonging that has little to do with any external incentive or benefit to be gained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After September 11, there were customers who sent cheques to Southwest Airlines to show their support. One note that accompanied a cheque for $1,000 read, “You’ve been so good to me over the years, in these hard times I wanted to say thank you by helping you out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHY: Very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY they do WHAT they do. When I say WHY, I don’t mean to make money—that’s a result. By WHY I mean what is your purpose, cause or belief? WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get out of bed every morning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say WHAT we do, we sometimes say HOW we do it, but we rarely say WHY we do WHAT we do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worth repeating: people don’t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies try to sell us WHAT they do, but we buy WHY they do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their products, unto themselves, are not the reason Apple is perceived as superior; their products, WHAT Apple makes, serve as the tangible proof of what they believe. It is that clear correlation between WHAT they do and WHY they do it that makes Apple stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing your WHY is not the only way to be successful, but it is the only way to maintain a lasting success and have a greater blend of innovation and flexibility. When a WHY goes fuzzy, it becomes much more difficult to maintain the growth, loyalty and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases, going back to the original purpose, cause or belief will help these industries adapt. Instead of asking, “WHAT should we do to compete?” the questions must be asked, “WHY did we start doing WHAT we’re doing in the first place&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great #leaders are those who trust their gut. They are those who understand the art before the science. They win hearts before minds. They are the ones who start with WHY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all starts with clarity. You have to know WHY you do WHAT you do. If people don’t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it, so it follows that if you don’t know WHY you do WHAT you do, how will anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For values or guiding principles to be truly effective they have to be verbs. It’s not “integrity,” it’s “always do the right thing.” It’s not “innovation,” it’s “look at the problem from a different angle.” Articulating our values as verbs gives us a clear idea...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask the most successful entrepreneurs and leaders what their secret is and invariably they all say the same thing: “I trust my gut.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of business should not be to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have. It should be to focus on the people who believe what you believe. When we are selective about doing business only with those who believe in our WHY, trust emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading is not the same as being the leader. Being the leader means you hold the highest rank, either by earning it. Leading, however, means that others willingly follow you—not because they have to, not because they are paid to, but because they want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not products or services that bind a company together.It’s not size and might that make a company strong, it’s the culture-the strong sense of beliefs and values that everyone, from the CEO to the receptionist, all share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great companies don’t hire skilled people and motivate them, they hire already motivated people and inspire them. People are either motivated or they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great organizations become great because the people inside the organization feel protected.The strong sense of culture creates a sense of belonging and acts like a net.People come to work knowing that their bosses,colleague and the organization as a whole will look out for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHY-types are focused on the things most people can’t see, like the future. HOW-types are focused on things most people can see and tend to be better at building structures and processes and getting things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although so many of them fancy themselves visionaries, in reality most successful entrepreneurs are HOW-types. Ask an entrepreneur what they love about being an entrepreneur and most will tell you they love to build things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best chief executives are WHY-types— who lead a cause and not just run a company.The best chief financial officers and chief operating officers are high-performing HOW-types, those with the strength to admit they are not visionaries themselves but are inspired by the vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees come first and if employees are treated right, they treat the outside world right, the outside world uses the company’s product again, and that makes the shareholders happy. That really is the way that it works and it’s not a conundrum at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great organizations don’t just drive profits, they lead people, and they change the course of industries and sometimes our lives in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if a company tries too many times to “seize market opportunities” inconsistent with their WHY over time, their WHY will go fuzzy and their ability to inspire and command loyalty will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don’t buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it, and Apple says and does only the things they believe. If WHAT you do doesn’t prove what you believe, then no one will know what your WHY is and you’ll be forced to compete on price, service, quality, features and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with an ability to never lose sight of WHY,no matter how little or how much they achieve, can inspire us.Those with the ability to never lose sight of WHY and also achieve the milestones that keep everyone focused in the right direction are the great leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can’t easily assess a company’s WHY simply from looking at their products,services,marketing and public statements, then odds are high that they don’t know what it is either. If they did, so would we.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinegal trusts his gut more than he trusts Wall Street analysts. “Wall Street is in the business of making money between now and next Tuesday,” he said.. “We’re in the business of building an organization, an institution that we hope will be here fifty years from now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law of Diffusion says that only 2.5 percent of the population has an innovator mentality—they are a group of people willing to trust their intuition and take greater risks than others. Most people don’t want to challenge the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder Walmart has lost its WHY on the basis of which Sam ran this great organisation that it was.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dont give up]]></title><description><![CDATA[Born & raised in #Accra #Ghana, a tiny country in the West Africa with a lot to offer.

&lt;p&gt;I grew up surrounded by a loving, joking &amp;#x26; tough type of friends that always support each other even amidst fighting. You can imagine being 4 friends in different age groups can cause a lot of fights growing up 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my issues🤷‍♀️! I always wanted to prove myself &amp;#x26; make my friends proud. A pressure that was just in my head; they were always proud of us. I wanted to grow up to be a pilot or an army officer. Let&apos;s just say I changed my mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The literacy rate &amp;#x26; level of #education in #Ghana is high, and like most cultures, most people end up following popular jobs &amp;#x26; studies either as an #engineer, a #doctor (#physician) or as #officers. I wanted something different in #biology or #science!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to keep up with society&apos;s #expectations &amp;#x26; #judgement; I am sure most of you understand.
No matter what you do, someone is going to complain; shout out to my one friend for telling me this everytime 🙌 , so follow YOUR path!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the same JHS school for 10 yrs. It was excellent! It taught 4 languages: English(main) &amp;#x26; Ga + French. My senior year, I chose Life&amp;#x26;Earth Sciences (SVT) to do the gov. official exams to enter uni. That is how my journey began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After passing the official exams, the search started. Which undergrad scientific program should I take🤔? Back then, a new BSc in sciences was offered @ucc so after doing my research, I thought I&apos;d dive in &amp;#x26; take the risk💪😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, I am not an A+ student, on each exam, my brain goes through a nervous cycle by overthinking details ; I learned to channel it. What&apos;s the next step?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job opportunities &amp;#x26; growth are difficult in #Ghana. You will be used, underpaid, unappreciated &amp;#x26; unable to secure a stable future. I started looking for a way out but that is a challenge by itself. There are a lot of obstacles, especially financially, to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In #Ghana, if you don&apos;t know the right people, you will not get really far. I got accepted into an architectural apprenticeship, a dream come true! I went to my friends, shared the news but for them I must have paid my way in so they didn&apos;t believe I got an apprenticeship. Haters gonna hate🤷‍♀️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started my apprenticeship, everything was going great, smoothly, experiments&amp;#x26;results were ➕. I completed 90% of the project in the 1st 4 months ✔. My superior asked me if I&apos;d like to fast track, I declined to apply for PR so instead they gave me the green light to start my own design works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what happened during the following year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kraken was loose🌬️🌊!
Another student was a fav. in the company &amp;#x26; I guess they didn&apos;t like the fact my projects was going well &amp;#x26; theirs wasn&apos;t. They started spreading rumors to my superior so he treated me as if I was invisible...no guidance,no help, other priorities!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stuck repeating 1 design for almost a 3 months because my results contradicted previous ones. In design meetings, my superior would skip over me or cut me short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to send a first mini draft to my superior of the design intro; the feedback was bad (worse draft ever). I decided enough is enough! I took charge&amp;#x26;with help from friends, I wrote the entire draft, demanded to be heard&amp;#x26; had a design submission deadline&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&apos;t all bad. That year I started realizing maybe I didn&apos;t want to do a Architecture, maybe I should look for options, maybe I am good at something else. Many architects that I met were great&amp;#x26;advised me to think it through. What were the options outside of Architecture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am #sociable &amp;#x26; I 💜 #science &amp;#x26; #research. #Lost, I started applying to any #job outside #achitecture 😅..went to #interviews, felt great but never got the job(no #workexperience). I was reading #advice from #CareerCoaches &amp;#x26; it hit me! My #apprenticeship was experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After learning from my #interviews #mistakes &amp;#x26; not giving up, I found a #job in #design. #Why? Because it has the #skills I wanted to land a #job in #architecture plus I needed it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I have being doing well! #Advancing on both #personal &amp;#x26; #professional levels. I am always #challenging myself &amp;#x26; trying to overcome the #challenges &amp;#x26; #obstacles in my #path! Every year is better than the one before! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know how most #job #candidates feel! You #apply &amp;#x26; apply...pass #interviews that went great but never get a #callback...you feel #down, #frustrated, #demotivated so it is #important to know you are #notalone, find your #niche, #support, #group &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to offer one #advice, it&apos;s #Dontgiveup! It is #easier #said than #done I know😅 but what is the worse thing that could happen? #noreply #nocall, so what? You #learn from #Your #Mistakes, #Interviews, #peoplesadvice. Any #experience is #goodexperience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&apos;t have made it to where I am #today without the #support &amp;#x26; #love from my  #friends so #ThankYouAll! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Happiness]]></title><description><![CDATA[Happiness is a range of feelings from positive emotions to great joy.

&lt;p&gt;Happiness changes the way we see ourselves and situations. Our happiness affects how we react in situations and interact with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😀 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that happiness supports: a stronger immune system, stronger resilience in the face of stress, a stronger heart and less risk of cardiovascular disease, alongside quicker recovery times when overcoming illness or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness maximises our ability to look after ourselves. Happiness supports more exercise, better socializing, healthy eating, good sleep hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you might think that happiness comes from money, status, power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well...think again.... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is a deep emotion...usually originating from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deep satisfaction in ourselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharing life with other happy individuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good #values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So are we #happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well a survey in 2017 found that only 46% of us are happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But #happiness is so good. 🖐️👍😀 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can we feel satisfied in ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s good to get to know who we are, what motivates us and be ourselves. So much happiness and freedom originates from feeling we can accept who we are and be comfortable with #Authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s ok to be ourselves 😍🖐️😀 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also helps if others around us are sensitive, #kind, #compassionate and #caring. 😀 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Care breeds happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compassion breeds happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love breeds happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gratitude breeds happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authenticity breeds happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teamwork (well spirited) breeds happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect breeds happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civility breeds happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness breeds happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving breeds happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gratitude and being thankful for all we have and in all we do can be a conduit for happiness. 😍👍 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be confident: Be happy 😍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe in yourself....just for a second imagine that you CAN make a positive impact 😍👍😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can inspire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can motivate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make an impact 😍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&apos;t feel happy right now, a smile can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One smile.....will lead to someone else smiling back at you...now even if it&apos;s for a moment it&apos;ll lead to a close of happiness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smile to the world and it will smile back 😀😍👍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake git pkg-config libgtk-3-dev \
libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev \
libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev \
gfortran openexr libatlas-base-dev python3-dev python-numpy \
libtbb2 libtbb-dev libdc1394-22-dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an opencv_build directory, cd into it and then clone the OpenCV and OpenCV contrib repositories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ mkdir ~/opencv_build &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd ~/opencv_build
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the download is complete, create a build directory and cd into it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cd ~/opencv_build/opencv
$ mkdir build &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now setup the build with CMake:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
-D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON \
-D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \
-D OPENCV_GENERATE_PKGCONFIG=ON \
-D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_build/opencv_contrib/modules \
-D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start compiling with make and then install, then verify if it was installed correctly:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ make -j(number of cores your cpu has), e.g. make -j2 or make -j4
$sudo make install
$ python3 -c  “import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to install OpenVINO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install OpenVINO, I consulted the official documentation here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs/openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_linux.html&quot;&gt;https://docs/openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_linux.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I will summarize the steps here to help you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to download OpenVINO from the link I provided. Register when prompted. Also, keep the serial number given to you.
Change directories to your downloads directory with $ cd ~/Downloads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file is saved in the directory as l&lt;em&gt;openvino&lt;/em&gt;toolkit&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;version&gt;.tgz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Untar the file using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ tar -xvf l_openvino_toolkit_p_&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;.tgz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then cd into the l&lt;em&gt;openvino&lt;/em&gt;toolkit&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;version&gt; directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cd l_openvino_toolkit_p_&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you can install either using a GUI or CLI Installation using the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ sudo ./install.sh 
Or 
$ sudo ./install_GUI.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the onscreen instructions and it will tell you what needs to be installed or what you will be prompted to install later. In my case it told me I would install libgtk2.0-dev.
You can customize or choose a default installation. Choose default if you’re new to this.
Openvino will be installed on the /opt/intel/openvino&lt;em&gt;&lt;version&gt; directory.
The first part of the installation will be complete, next you have to set up the variables, configure the model optimizer and add dependencies.
Change to the install&lt;/em&gt;dependencies directory with $ cd /opt/intel/openvino/install_dependencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the script to download the needed dependencies with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ sudo -E ./install_openvino_dependencies.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next set your variables with the &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;command. Optionally you can add it to your .bashrc file in the last line. Use nano or vi to edit the file. Just add that line at the end and source it.
Next, configure the model optimizer by changing to the prerequisites directory with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cd /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/install_prerequisites&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to start the process. Then run the script to configure the model optimizer with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ sudo ./install_prerequisites.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to install only a specified model use the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ sudo ./install_prequisites_&amp;lt;model name&amp;gt;.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;command instead.
To verify installation, go to the Inference Engine demo directory with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cd /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/demo.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run the image classification verification script with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ ./demo_squeezenet_download_convert_run.sh.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it says execution successful then it has run correctly.
Next, run the Inference Pipeline verification script with &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ ./demo_security_barrier_camera.sh.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it completes you should get an image that displays the resulting frame with detections rendered as bounding boxes and text. Your framerate will vary depending on the machine you have. Close the window to verify installation.
Congratulations, you have installed OpenVINO. Optionally you can add dependencies for Intel Processor graphics or a VPU such as the Compute Sitck 2. Those you can find on the documentation I provided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s it. That’s how I successfully installed OpenVINO on my machine.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[What do you want?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Answer this question: What do you want?

&lt;p&gt;What do you want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can have everything they want, but they can focus intently to gain what they want most. What do you want most?
Answer it. Not in general terms, but in very specific ones. Then answer this question:
WHY DO YOU WANT IT AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO GET IT?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In defining why you want something, you often clarify and intensify your determination.
You also often develop seeds for your plan of action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key here is to remember an immutable law that deals with free will. You are free to seek what you will. But you are not free to impose your will on any other.
These questions should be about you. Not about anyone else. How you can improve yourself, your life, your future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re constantly replaying old unworthiness tapes, or you spend a lot of time focusing on what’s wrong in your life or with everyone else, you’re on the wrong track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect others and yourself and recognize that replaying those tapes over and over isn’t accomplishing a thing that will benefit you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Look within. Your answers and benefits lie there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set a goal. Make a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t go into specifics here.
Far too many slide day-to-day, going through the motions of living without investing in anything that excites them or arouses any passion for what they’re doing. That’s a problem. It’s a poor substitution for a life.
Don’t get so caught up in busy-ness that you don’t even remember your wishes, hopes or dreams. And if you have forgotten them, pull them out of cold storage, dust them off and see if they’re still your wishes, hopes and dreams or if it’s time for an update–or even an overhaul
If it is, do it. You should be excited about your life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upshot: Don’t drift, design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolve to try at least one new thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do, you might find a new passion. If you don’t, you won’t.
You might be missing something that could mean a great deal to you–and the saddest thing about that is, if you don’t try it, you might never know it.
I’m reminded of a story I heard long ago about a guy caught in a flood. On three different occasions help came: a neighbor, a camel and a guy in a boat. On each occasions the man stranded in the rising floodwaters refused help, saying he was waiting on God to come help him.
Well, the stranded guy drowned, hooked up with his Maker, and boy he was ticked. He demanded to know why God hadn’t come. God replied that he’d sent three different people to help. What exactly did the guy want?
The moral of the story: Sometimes we’re so fixed on what we think opportunity looks like that we fail to recognize it when it comes. Of course, that won’t happen to you if you’re open to new things…
Adopt an attitude of gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all I’ve written here, this is by far the most important.
It’s easy to fall into a hotbed of negativity or into a bad situation that sucks you dry, sows more seeds of discontent, or steals so much of your energy and focus that you grow inextricably mired in it and lose sight of what’s good and going right in your life.
When that happens, we react emotionally and that’s just not a good idea because our emotions aren’t reliable. We need balance to function with stability.
We all have challenges. No one escapes them. But if we focus only on the challenges (versus on solutions to them and other things) then we’re doomed to a very rocky, very unstable road and that is definitely not in our best interests–or in anyone else’s.
To gain more balance–which leads to more stable, less dramatic (and melodramatic) events that inflict trauma on us (and often on unsuspecting others)–we need only counter what’s wrong with what’s right. Counter challenges with blessings. See the good and be grateful for it.
Sometimes that’s easier to do than at other times. I’m reminded of something Osteen once said about gratitude: There are times when the best you can do is to be grateful you’re not like x. (He pointed mid-air and said like him/her–I don’t recall which.)
The intent in what he said fits situations and events as well as people. Be grateful for little things as well as the big ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often learn most from the things we tag as “bad.” We all have something to celebrate.
Where you focus, you follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you act, you think. And if you allow your thoughts to run wild and unchecked, you diminish the chances of them being in your best interest.
Anyone, given enough time, can rationalize and reason himself right out of good sense–and rob himself of accomplishments and even his destiny.
If you spend your time focused on the right things, good and constructive things, you’ll be purpose-driven and accomplish.
If you spend your time focused on the wrong things, on negative or destructive things, you’ll follow that path and purpose and accomplishment (not to mention happiness and contentment) will elude you.
You choose which you’ll do. You choose what you focus on and give your energy–how you spend your life. That’s as it should be. Again, you’re responsible and accountable for it, and you will live with the joy or regret of your choices. Now some will be busy weeknights and that’s just terrific. It’s also why I’m posting all of this on the weekday—so you have time to read and review and think about your life before next week starts.
These things I’ve shared, in my humble opinion, are worthy opportunities. Ones that recognize, analyze and act to position you for powerful, meaningful personal gains in taking control of your life. For that and so much more, I am grateful.
Put them to work in your life. What have you got to lose? More of the same? If they work, and you take control of your life instead of it running you, you&apos;ll have all the more reason to sleep peacefully and celebrate each morning. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Take control of your life]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tonight the door closes on today.

For some, it’s been a good day. For others, the best they can say is soon it will be over. For the majority of us, today was a mix of good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we view the day largely depends on how we view its events or what events dominated our thoughts and time (more so than the actual events themselves) and the impact those events had on our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that offers us an opportunity to look back with distance, a little objectivity, and also with the gems of wisdom we’ve gained from all we’ve added to our personal skills treasure chest, and that reflection, aided by perspective, brings us our biggest opportunities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What biggest opportunities? Well, let’s think about that a second…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in a position to review. We can choose what we want to keep in our lives and what we want to cull from our lives. We can choose what we like and what we want to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change. We typically shudder at the word much less the actions that come with it because change means we have to move outside our comfort zone. Even if the way things are aren’t as we’d like or they downright suck, they’re known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving into the unknown carries uncertainty and that scares our socks off. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because change often is accompanied by conflict or challenges. That makes it a pain for us, and often for those around us who don’t want us to change. They like us as we are, even if we’re not content. Change is work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re tired already, but if we’re not content , we’re not going to get content by staying on a treadmill where we’re not content. And if we don’t do the work necessary to get off the thing, the simple fact is we’ll stay on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have choose: park and pay, or move and endure until we are content. You can gloss it over all you like, but facts are facts. You want different? Create it, deal with challenges and conflicts and revamp until you are content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others will accept or reject it. That’s their choice. You must take charge of your choices. Bottom line, you’re responsible for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is one part recognition, one part analysis, and one part action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t get off the treadmill if you don’t realize you’re on it. You’re stuck being unfulfilled or discontent with life as you know it unless you know why you’re unfulfilled or discontent. So you must take a hard, honest look at your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore what has you unfulfilled, unhappy or discontent. Once you peg specifics, then switch focus to solutions. What can you do to make wise corrections to better your situation? Once you know what has you feeling less than terrific, you’ll know what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really think about your solutions. Nail them down. Be specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing. You can recognize all the challenges in the world and think on them for a lifetime, but if you don’t actually put a potential solution to work in your life, you’re not changing a thing to better your situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that means tomorrow night you’ll be sitting right where you are, complaining about the same things you complained about tonight (and perhaps the night before, and the one before that). You must act&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, if it’s broken, fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have to explore a few solutions before hitting on the “perfect” one for you. Some will try one thing, not like the result, and consider that failure. It’s not. You know it didn’t work. Try something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s okay to not like solutions and keep seeking the right solution for you. This isn’t a one-size fits all bit of business. We’re talking about YOUR contentment. YOUR happiness. YOUR feeling fulfilled. Those things mean something different for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many try one thing, don’t like it, and give up or give in—and remain discontent and unhappy and unfulfilled. Who loses in that? Why do they value their own peace so little to quit and not try again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only they can answer, but my heart breaks for them. Because they think they have failed and quit trying, they have failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those who say, “Well, that didn’t work, I’ll try this next.” Those people who keep exploring will find the right potential solution for them. In a very real sense, they fail their way to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve been taught that failure is a bad thing. But think about it. If you gain something–and knowing what you don’t want/what doesn’t work is every bit as important as knowing what you do want and what does work–then that’s growth, and it is success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re not where you want to be, but you’re closer. You know now these potential solutions you’ve tried don’t work for you. Try others. You dig enough, you’re going to find the perfect solution for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been told repeatedly that failure is bad, then consider the previous statement your personal license to fail. Go ahead and just fail your way to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you close the door on today, review it. Recognize the problem points for you, analyze them seeking solutions, then implement them. Always nurture the good and cull the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that culling isn’t always painless or welcome (others often don’t like for us to change) but each of us must do what we feel is right. We must remember that doing the right thing is easy when it costs us nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we pay dearly for it, however, is when
we gain the most. Think about it. Have you learned more, gained more from the hard knock lessons you’ve been through, or from the wins?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, like it or not, we are responsible for what we do and do not do, and we will be held accountable for what we do and don’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also bear the fruit and/or burden of what we’ve done and not done. It&apos;s important to remember those little facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is a cut-and-run license. This is an evaluate-and-cull-what’s-no-longer-constructive-in-shaping-your-life-so-you-fulfill-your-purpose license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing less leaves you only with regret, and no one deserves only regret. Neither does anyone skate away from the consequences of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New beginnings require we put old endings to bed. It’s hard to focus on new ventures when we’re dealing with remnants of the old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some overlap is inevitable, but the less of the old we have to contend with in the time where our focus should be on the new, the better our odds are of improving our position and making headway on the new and of building momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum is a powerful force. We put down a foundation. Upon it, we build. If one section is framed, we’re limited to going any farther on that one section. If two or three sections are framed, then expansion is possible on all sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum builds momentum. So the less time we spend in the past (deal with the old and get it done) the more time we have to invest in the future (welcome the new).
So do what you can to clear the decks–and that includes accepting what you can’t change. Don’t repress it, accept it. And then press on.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[What will i tell my younger self?]]></title><description><![CDATA[I sat at a café at Murtala Muhammed International  Airport last August, planning my answer to a question that I had been asked at two important events within a short span of time…]]></description><link>https://www.kojobartels.com//what-will-i-tell-my-younger-self/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.kojobartels.com//what-will-i-tell-my-younger-self/</guid><category><![CDATA[life]]></category><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I sat at a café at Murtala Muhammed International  Airport last August, planning my answer to a question that I had been asked at two important events within a short span of time in Accra, Ghana and Nairobi, Kenya. The question was “What would I tell my younger self?”. My answer is I have a lot to tell him, but where do I begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question requires deep and honest reflection, identifying what I could have done differently if I was to start again, and what I am glad I did. I am glad I finally got to finish my reflection at the beginning of 2020, a new year and new decade full of promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here we go on 10 reflections!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be authentic: No one can beat you at being YOU. Developing a personal brand is an ongoing process over the years. You build your reputation by staying true to your values, beliefs and convictions unapologetically and with confidence. In other words, stay true to yourself. I have an issue with the advice of “faking it till you make it”. You can easily spend a lot of time trying to be someone else instead of using the time to learn from your mistakes and build on your strengths - the surest path to be the best version of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dream: about where you want to go and not where you are now. This is true for every aspiration whether you are talking about money, career, home, overcoming hindrances and so on. The stars will align at some point because life is not one straight journey. Many times, you will make two steps forward and then one step back. So as long as there is progress, you will be fine. Always remember the “Me Inc.” mentality, that you are the best CEO of YOU. If you do not have a vision for yourself, you will follow someone else in theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-learn and re-invent: the majority of people succeed at a workplace simply because they have an attitude that says, “I will learn from my mistakes, I will re-invent myself, I will build my competency and I will ask for help”. Few succeed only because they have some special ability or talent that the rest don’t have. I have learnt that being successful in employment is not easy! “Wanting to” matters, not just “skills”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a friend graduating from University, He was posted to teach at a secondary school. He was NOT satisfied with the status quo. First of all, the government did not pay him for the first 4 months. Secondly, all his friends from high school seemed set. Many turned down government jobs, as they were able to go abroad for further studies or join family businesses or secure good jobs in Nairobi through their networks. He was restless. His GOAL then was simple; He needed to be financially independent and stable. He wanted the next challenge that would help him make progress. He even enrolled for an evening class in Banking and volunteered at a Youth Camp over weekends and school holidays! It did not take very long before He was approached by the Director of an international Christian Mission to join the organization and help start a school. His heart and his mind were ready to re-invent and He said YES. The lessons He learnt in setting up the school were invaluable and formed his foundation for the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take advantage of every opportunity: I work in the technology sector even though I am not an IT or digital native. By taking advantage of various opportunities, accepting to try different things, learning and re-learning, I moved from one industry to another. Opportunities abound. Take advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not fear to fail: Accept failures and obstacles as part of life’s journey because they will surely visit once in a while. It helps to have a short memory! Don’t spend too much time wallowing in pity. In the early 2010’s, as a young entrepreneur and after investing a lot of time, energy and emotion in pursuing an opportunity (that would have changed my life!), I lost it to competition. I could not get out of bed for days! It took my caring friend’s support and nudging for me to get up and face the world again! I learnt some lessons, changed my approach and two years later, I did get an opportunity that changed my life! You may fall down many times, but you won’t be a failure until you blame it on others or refuse to stand up, learn from it and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to say No: In our society, it is easy to feel obligated to say yes to every request that comes your way. I have learnt over the years that it is OK to say NO, especially to innocuous and well-intentioned requests. I have learnt trying to please everyone can stretch you to your limits, bring you disappointments and rob you of your freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard your mind and heart: This has to do with the company you keep and what you internalize. Be intentional about the company you keep. If they are time wasters you will end up being one. If they are progressive people, chances are you will become progressive. If they are pessimists and &quot;downies”, chances are you will find yourself with the same negative disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manage your Time: When you are young, one of the things you don’t have is money. My view is that even though you may not have the notes from central bank YET, you have time, and this IS money. You don’t necessarily need money to do phenomenal things. As a young person, treat time like money, understanding that it is not limitless and therefore you must plan and use it well by reading, inventing, taking risks, volunteering, learning and gaining experience. Eventually, you will become good at what you do, and people will be willing to pay you money for your time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Solomon, arguably the wisest man that ever lived puts it this way in Ecclesiastes 9:11. “I have seen something else under the sun: the race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one last thing! save and invest from your early earnings – before you know it, retirement is beckoning. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to deploy springboot application on aws elastic beanstalk]]></title><description><![CDATA[To continue with article you will need  a AWS account ( there is a free-tier account) , then visit the Beanstalk service page,  https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk…]]></description><link>https://www.kojobartels.com//how-to-deploy-springboot-application-on-aws:elastic-beanstalk/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.kojobartels.com//how-to-deploy-springboot-application-on-aws:elastic-beanstalk/</guid><category><![CDATA[aws]]></category><category><![CDATA[elastic beanstalk]]></category><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To continue with article you will need  a AWS account ( there is a free-tier account) , then visit the Beanstalk service page,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk&quot;&gt;https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk&lt;/a&gt;  this where our focus will be. We will be deploying a  Spring boot web application, though there are services for other platforms such as  .NET,  PHP,  Node.js,  Python,  Ruby,  Go, etc More:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/GettingStarted.CreateApp.html&quot;&gt;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/GettingStarted.CreateApp.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;NB: You might need permissions if you&amp;#39;re using a company aws account&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&apos;ve signed-in onto your AWS beanstalk console, click the Create New Application  to get started and fill the pop form with your app name and it&apos;s description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We  have to setup a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;code pipeline&lt;/code&gt; for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/&quot;&gt;AWS CodePipeline&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

Leave everything to default, except these marked fields above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the Next button  and select Elastic Beanstalk in the deployment section followed by the application name and the application environment.  That&apos;s all. The pipeline will try to clone from the source, build and deploy, but it will fail at the build  stage because it&apos;s lacking a buildspec file which we selected to be used for build. So we have to include a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;buildspec.yml&lt;/code&gt; file with the content below in the root directory of our project and push code to github. The change will be picked by your pipeline and it will be built by running your test, if they pass then your application will be bundled into a jar file and deployed for you automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NB: This buildspec is for a spring boot application with a gradle build tool. The build instruction will change based on the build too you&apos;re using . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember:  Change the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;appname&lt;/code&gt; to your application name settings.gradle file and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/code&gt; to the version specified in your build.gradle file&lt;/p&gt;

Society never teaches that it is possible to love ourselves. Understand that unless you love yourself, you cannot possibly love another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when you lose yourself to yourself can you lose yourself to others. We are taught that we can only love even ourselves if we have a reason. If we perform well, we love ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we fail, we hate ourselves. We apply the same logic to others. We love them only because of something, never without a cause or a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you don’t love yourself, you become cynical and negative towards life. When you were alone in your mother’s womb, you were completely loving and blissful. In your aloneness in the womb you experienced your loving self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why you will see that you assume the fetal posture whenever you lie down with insecurity. Blissful aloneness is your original nature. Once you came into the world, society conditioned you to believe that you needed people and television to be loving and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never nurtured your original quality. Your original quality is blissful aloneness. If you get back in touch with that, you will settle down and feel peaceful and relaxed within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few minutes every day, just sit by yourself and feel overflowing love towards yourself. Feel what a wonderful being you are. Feel how much you have taken yourself for granted. Feel yourself as part of Existence and love yourself for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melt with the feeling of love for yourself. If you practice this everyday you will see that where you were once hard and self-centered, now you have become soft and loving. When you deeply settle down within yourself with peace and love, bliss will explode in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your nerves are clean, when your nervous system is cleaned by peace, bliss will explode. You will start expressing the same bliss that is expressed in the master’s body language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then when people love you, you don’t feel guilty or unworthy because just as they love you, you love yourself too. You become ready to receive love from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually when others show love to you, you feel guilty or unworthy because you don’t feel you are worth being loved. Once you settle within yourself with deep love, you will receive others’ love with joy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Git commands]]></title><description><![CDATA[Git Commands A list of my commonly used Git commands.

&lt;p&gt;Authentication is validating the credentials of an entity by verifying his user name and password to prove his identity. Authentication systems in a nutshell determines whether you are what you say you are using your credentials provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorization which is normally done after authentication and it grants an entity permission to access certain resources on a system. This could be databases or simple files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service provider(SP) is a services that are requesting  authentication and identity information about user. In our case this is our node(angular) application Service providers take authentication responses received from  identity providers and use that information to create and configure sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identity Provider(IdP) is a service that serves as the source of identity information and authentication decision. Identity providers authenticate users and return identity information to service providers. In our case this is Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP Bindings are the means by which data is exchanged between the SP and the IdP. The usual ones our application will use HTTP POST and HTTP redirect bindings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets say we have an angular application called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Oh yes&lt;/code&gt; which is owned by a company, successfully deployed and must be used by  its employees only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin the login process,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;The user tries to log in to ```Oh yes``` from a browser.&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;```Oh yes``` responds by generating a SAML Authentication Request. The ```Authentication Request``` is often sent using HTTP Redirect Binding, and ends up looking something like this&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In return you would receive an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SSO URL&lt;/code&gt;, an &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ISSUER ID&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;certificate&lt;/code&gt; to use in our node entry point file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for the above to work for in our application, we employ the use of some node dependencies such as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bergie/passport-saml&quot;&gt;passport - Saml&lt;/a&gt;: Authentication provider for Passport &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser#readme&quot;&gt;body-parser&lt;/a&gt;: Node js body parsing middleware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser#readme&quot;&gt;cookie-parser&lt;/a&gt;: Parsing Cookie headers in our application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simolaev , for those who do not know him, is a Moroccan youth who entered the field of work on the Internet for more than 10 years, thus becoming one of the first young Moroccans to see on the Internet something other than MSN Messenger and its sisters; from chat and dating sites and sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This young man started selling traditional Moroccan carpets on the eBay website, and the revenues he earned from this trade went to one of his relatives in France before the latter transferred it to its owner in Morocco via Western Union, and the reason is known, and that is, the means of payment that was provided by eBay, none of them were supported In Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short period, this commercial activity stopped due to special circumstances that Muhammad Baabit (the real name of Simolife) went through, but this short period was sufficient to convince the young man that work and profit from the Internet is a real fact and not just a myth or a lie as most people in Morocco believed at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulayev then went deeper into what is known as profit methods from the Internet, and he learned by himself how to be a successful online marketer until he became one of the most famous Arab marketers on the Internet, and he managed to make profits worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from Click Bank alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Simulayev chose to settle in Thailand, but he did not sever his ties with Morocco and young Moroccans, as he remained in near-regular contact with them on various social media. His reputation among the Moroccan internet pioneers has grown to set an example for many of them thanks to the advice and directions as well as the stimulus doses he provides to them in his videos spread on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, I went inside to watch one of these videos on YouTube, and I didn&apos;t know then that this view would change my way of thinking a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that video, Simulayev said that he believed with certainty that idiots usually succeed more than smart people, for one reason is that most of the successful people were ready to repeat the same tasks daily without being tired or bored until they reach the results and goals they set at the beginning. This repetition and continuing to do the same thing and focus on it is not usually done by people who count themselves as smart, because they are always looking for shortcuts to achieve their goals, while the few who are successful fully realize that success is not an easy issue and only comes with work, hard work and patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this idea or theory was not invented by Simulayev and not by him. Einstein said it decades ago when he denied himself the quality of supernatural intelligence and attributed his success and innovations to his permanent and continuous attempts to solve the problems facing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all geniuses and successful people have experienced persistence and perseverance, it is said that Thomas Edison made more than &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;1,000&lt;/code&gt; failed &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;attempts&lt;/code&gt; to make a light bulb before finally succeeding in his goal. There is an English wisdom tha says &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;repetition is the mother of learning&lt;/code&gt; , so imagine with me if you intend to succeed as a blogger and start posting a blog every day or two, after a year you will have published at least 200 posts, and after two years you will reach 400 posts. Is not this large number of posts a guarantor By making your blog known and successful whatever the field in which you write?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem facing most of those who did not succeed  is the rush to profit and expecting to harvest the fruits after the first or second attempt, this is nonsense! They count themselves smart, so they leave to find an easier way to make money. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;There is no easy way to earn money! There is only work, fatigue, patience and results will come next&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real intelligence is not the search for easy and short ways to achieve big goals, but intelligence is to draw goals and develop a realistic plan of action and perseverance on them without fatigue or boredom,  &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;even if this will make you appear in front of others stupid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item><item><title><![CDATA[Take up responsibility]]></title><description><![CDATA[When you take up responsibility, a cognitive shift happens in you.

Your mental setup changes. For example, if you work eight hours in your office just following orders you will feel dull and tired. Instead, if you take up responsibility and initiative, that same eight hours will become much easier and more enjoyable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the case of a person who is running his own business and another person who is working for a company. The owner of the business has the full responsibility of his business, but the person who is working for some other company does not really feel the full responsibility.  If he does not feel the responsibility, the whole job becomes like a burden on him. There is little or no self-motivation. He keeps looking at his watch to see if it is time to leave! For him, only the first of every month is sweet, since it is payday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sense of personal responsibility can help turn around any situation. A sense of personal responsibility can achieve great things. When you stand up with responsibility, you become a solid force. Until then, you remain a burden for yourself and for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think that we are in an ordinary job. We wonder why we should take up more responsibility when our higher authorities at work are not doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you, in an office, when a janitor does all his duties perfectly, he will inspire people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the head of the organization has to be responsible. No credit is given to him for that! But someone in a lesser position demonstrating such responsibility is a true inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a greater chance of people at a lower post inspiring others through their sense of responsibility than people at a higher level doing so. So don’t wait to get some authority to become responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, don’t think that you are in a lesser post, and therefore you need not be responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, allow the cognitive shift to happen in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that when a person went to beg, He would appear like a king, and the people who gave Him alms would appear like beggars!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing like a beggar or a king is not because of your status or the property that you own. It is because of the state inside you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you take up responsibility for the entire cosmos, you will expand and look like a leader, you will become a leader. Even if a leader sits on his throne and does not take responsibility, but instead points his finger at others for responsibility, he will appear small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state is that which gets the status. The status can never get the state. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;The state of Responsibilty is different from the status of Responsibility&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><author>bartelssamuel20@gmail.com</author></item></channel></rss>
