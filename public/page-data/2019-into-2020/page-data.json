I'm planning to write more next year on advanced JS topics.</p>\n<!-- ## I started 2 open-source projects\n\nI started two projects - [TakeNote](https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote) and [Chip8](https://github.com/taniarascia/chip8). Both are works in progress, almost complete.\n\n### TakeNote\n\n[TakeNote](https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote) is my biggest, most ambitious project yet - a Markdown note-taking app for the web, written in TypeScript with functional React and Redux. What makes it unique? Ultimately, it will store all your notes in a GitHub repo. Therefore, the app has no backend - just authentication and storage through GitHub. Right now, the app is about 90% complete, with all the functionality ready, but it's using local storage to store all the data until the sync with GitHub's APIs are complete.\n\nTakeNote is huge for me, as it's been my first large-scale collaborative effort. It has been built with the help of [30 contributors](https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote/graphs/contributors)! At one point it even reached the top spot on GitHub trending, and I was overwhelmed with pull requests for a week or two. I'm excited to get this finished, and I learned a ton about TypeScript, Redux, and Hooks while building it.\n\nHere is the current example site: [TakeNote.dev](https://takenote.dev/).\n\n### Chip8.js\n\n[Chip8.js](https://github.com/taniarascia/chip8) is very different from everything else I've done, and pretty different from what most people do in JavaScript. It's an emulator that interprets Chip8 roms, which were used in some 1970s microcomputers. It plays simple games like Pong, Tetris, Space Invaders, and so on.\n\nWhile Chip8 emulators have been done before in JavaScript, what makes this one unique is the generic CPU interface it uses to hook up to multiple different graphical interfaces. There's a browser version, a terminal version, and a native GUI version of Chip8.js, all of which share the same CPU. I learned a ton while writing this, and I plan to write about the whole process once it's totally finished. It's at about 90% complete at the moment as well.\n\nYou can view the browser version here: [Chip8 Web](https://taniarascia.github.io/chip8/) (However, it only uses key input and they're not listed, so doing anything might be difficult until I add those instructions).\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nI made a few small other projects.\n\n- [MVC Todo](https://taniarascia.github.io/mvc) ([Source](https://github.com/taniarascia/mvc))\n- [Snake (Terminal)](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek)\n- [Webpack Boilerplate](https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate) -->\n<h2 id=\"i-moved-from-wordpress-to-gatsby\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-moved-from-wordpress-to-gatsby\" aria-label=\"i moved from wordpress to gatsby permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I moved from WordPress to Gatsby</h2>\n<p>It's hard to believe that this site was on WordPress from 2015 to 2019, and it wasn't until the middle of 2019 that I finally moved to Gatsby. I wrote <a href=\"/migrating-from-wordpress-to-gatsby/\">The End of an Era: Migrating from WordPress to Gatsby</a> as I migrated to help others wanting to make the switch. It was time consuming, but incredibly worth it. Being able to write my posts in Markdown is amazing, and I can't imagine having it any other way.</p>\n<!-- ## I did 2 presentations\n\nPublic speaking is not my strong suit, but I like doing at least one per year to keep in practice. This year, I did [Getting Started with Vue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPVI1wd7Uo0) and [An Introduction to React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35-WmqaQCj8&t=) at [JavaScript Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/js-chi/).\n\n## I made 2,383 commits\n\nThis statistic doesn't really matter, but it's a fun little graph to make this page a little more visual.\n\n![](../images/contributions2019.png)\n\n- **2015** - 383\n- **2016** - 715\n- **2017** - 655\n- **2018** - 856\n- **2019** - 2,383 -->\n<!-- Why such a discrepancy between this year and all the rest? My current job is the only one that has had their organization on GitHub, so it's the only one in which the contributions I make at work have counted towards my GitHub contributions - explaining why nearly every Monday to Friday is green. Weekends are open-source projects. -->\n<!-- \n## I have 18 Patrons\n\n- [My Patreon page](https://patreon.com/taniarascia)\n\nWow. You are all amazing. It's humbling to have so much support. I haven't started using Patreon until recently, and I'm really happy that people have decided to support me. Right now, the system is just a voluntary supporter basis, as I'm not sure what I should offer Patrons for signing up. If you have any ideas on that, please [let me know](mailto:hello@taniarascia.com)!\n\nI have also received a lifetime amount of **878** coffee donations on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/taniarascia).

Now it has <strong>8,430</strong>! I hate spam, and I basically never want to receive any email that isn't directly from a person to me, so I send as few emails as possible. Usually around one per month, when I write something new.</p>\n<p>So far, my newsletter journey has been <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">MailChimp</a> to <a href=\"https://sendy.co/\">Sendy</a> to <a href=\"https://substack.com/\">Substack</a>. MailChimp was good, but their prices become obnoxiously high after you reach the limit (which is 1k or 2k subscribers, something along those lines). The lowest tier was way beyond my budget, since my newsletter is simple a subscription service that does not sell anything and does not make me any money. I then bought Sendy for about $60 and set it up on an AWS EC2 server with SES for email. Unfortunately, AWS kept sending all my emails directly to spam for no reason, and after about 15-20 emails back and forth with their support, I finally switched. Then a week later, they sent me an email acknowledging that the issue was on their end and it was fixed now, but by then I had already moved on.</p>\n<p>So now I use <a href=\"https://substack.com/\">Substack</a>, which is awesome! It seems too good to be true, because I get to send my simple emails for free. Hopefully they stick around.</p>\n<!-- ## I had 3.2 million sessions\n\nFrom **December 21, 2018** to **December 21, 2019**, there were **3,199,780** sessions on this website, compared to **1,910,587** from the previous year. **85%** of that traffic comes from organic search (Google).\n\n![](../images/seo2019.png) -->\n<h2 id=\"i-drew-a-few-things\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-drew-a-few-things\" aria-label=\"i drew a few things permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I drew a few things</h2>\n<p>I drew a few things, including this goat and fish, both as gifts for my boyfriend.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fish\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#fish\" aria-label=\"fish permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Fish</h3>\n<p>Pen and watercolor pencils.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

In my <a href=\"/full-stack-cookies-localstorage-react-express/\">authentication</a> article, I laid out how to save authentication state on the front end in a secure way. This is huge for me, because it allows me to be comfortable creating the entire architecture for projects, which moves me out of the junior/mid-level developer category, and makes me feel confident about my work.</p>\n<!-- ### Underlying concepts of how a CPU works\n\nIn my ongoing [Chip8.js](https://github.com/taniarascia/chip8) project, I created a CPU and learned about memory, registers, stacks, instructions, working with binary, hex, big and little endian, masking, buffers, and bitwise operators. I have tons I want to write about on this subject, and so far I've written about [bits, bytes, and bases (2, 10, 16)](/bits-bytes-bases-and-a-hex-dump-javascript/). -->\n<!-- ### Webpack\n\nWebpack was always something I tried to avoid at all costs, and didn't entirely understand how to use. I decided that I needed to learn it very well, as Webpack comes up often in basically any front end project. I wrote [the Webpack 4 Boilerplate](https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate), which is a well-commented and very good starting point and is suitable for production. I learned about modules, loaders, plugins, and all the major Webpack concepts. This boilerplate has all the necessities, and any other add-ons (TypeScript, React) will just require adding a single loader. I'm now comfortable setting up my own Webpack config for production (instead of using Create React App) and I have a lot more control. -->\n<h3 id=\"advanced-testing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#advanced-testing\" aria-label=\"advanced testing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Advanced testing</h3>\n<p>Before this year, I hadn't done much with testing beyond setting up a few unit tests in <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest</a>, but this year I got a ton of practice using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest\">Supertest</a> in Node/Express and <a href=\"https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library\">React Testing Library</a> for React component tests. I learned about mocking API calls, simulating user interactions, and much more.

I can't decide if I like Vue or React more (though I really wish React had something like <code class=\"language-text\">$emit</code>) but I feel comfortable using both equally at this point. I wrote <a href=\"/getting-started-with-vue/\">Getting Started with Vue</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"more-react-hooks-context\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#more-react-hooks-context\" aria-label=\"more react hooks context permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>More React (Hooks, Context)</h3>\n<p>I ended 2018 by writing <a href=\"/crud-app-in-react-with-hooks/\">Building a CRUD App in React with Hooks</a> to teach myself React Hooks, as they were brand new at the time. I wrote some more articles on React, about <a href=\"/using-context-api-in-react/\">Context</a> and <a href=\"/using-react-router-spa/\">Routing</a>. I built TakeNote entirely with functional React Hooks and Redux, though I still find React Classes to be more intuitive, personally. React is ever-evolving and I use it on a daily basis, so I'm sure I'll end up learning a bunch more about React next year, too.</p>\n<!-- ### Redux\n\nI put off learning Redux for a long time. Every time I looked at it, it just seemed very overwhelming and different than anything else I'd done. I built [TakeNote](https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote) with Redux, so I was learning something alongside building it, and alongside learning TypeScript. It was a bit of a challenge, but now I understand why Redux is so useful, and at what point an app might need it. (For example, I built an app in plain Context recently, and it has become large enough that I feel like I should convert it to Redux soon.) -->\n<!-- ### TypeScript\n\nI had never used TypeScript before this year, so I decided to write [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/taniarascia/tictactoe) in TypeScript to teach myself, then applied that to [TakeNote](https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote). I'm not sure if I'm quite the TypeScript evangelist that some people are yet, but I do find it interesting and useful to learn, and it's helpful for catching a certain class of bugs. I want to write an overview of TypeScript soon. -->\n<h3 id=\"gatsby\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#gatsby\" aria-label=\"gatsby permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Gatsby</h3>\n<p>I moved to Gatsby, which I chose as my static site generator because of how fast it is, and the fact that it uses React, which I'm most familiar with.
