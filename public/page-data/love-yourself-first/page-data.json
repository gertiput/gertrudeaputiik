Society never teaches that it is possible to love ourselves. Understand that unless you love yourself, you cannot possibly love another person.</p>\n<p>Only when you lose yourself to yourself can you lose yourself to others. We are taught that we can only love even ourselves if we have a reason. If we perform well, we love ourselves.</p>\n<p>If we fail, we hate ourselves. We apply the same logic to others. We love them only because of something, never without a cause or a reason.</p>\n<p>When you don’t love yourself, you become cynical and negative towards life. When you were alone in your mother’s womb, you were completely loving and blissful. In your aloneness in the womb you experienced your loving self.</p>\n<p>That is why you will see that you assume the fetal posture whenever you lie down with insecurity. Blissful aloneness is your original nature. Once you came into the world, society conditioned you to believe that you needed people and television to be loving and happy.</p>\n<p>It never nurtured your original quality. Your original quality is blissful aloneness. If you get back in touch with that, you will settle down and feel peaceful and relaxed within yourself.</p>\n<p>For a few minutes every day, just sit by yourself and feel overflowing love towards yourself. Feel what a wonderful being you are. Feel how much you have taken yourself for granted. Feel yourself as part of Existence and love yourself for it.</p>\n<p>Melt with the feeling of love for yourself. If you practice this everyday you will see that where you were once hard and self-centered, now you have become soft and loving. When you deeply settle down within yourself with peace and love, bliss will explode in you.</p>\n<p>When your nerves are clean, when your nervous system is cleaned by peace, bliss will explode. You will start expressing the same bliss that is expressed in the master’s body language.</p>\n<p>Then when people love you, you don’t feel guilty or unworthy because just as they love you, you love yourself too. You become ready to receive love from others.</p>\n<p>Usually when others show love to you, you feel guilty or unworthy because you don’t feel you are worth being loved. Once you settle within yourself with deep love, you will receive others’ love with joy.</p>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"The big problem today is that most people don’t love themselves.
