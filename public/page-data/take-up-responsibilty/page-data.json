Your mental setup changes. For example, if you work eight hours in your office just following orders you will feel dull and tired. Instead, if you take up responsibility and initiative, that same eight hours will become much easier and more enjoyable. </p>\n<p>Take the case of a person who is running his own business and another person who is working for a company. The owner of the business has the full responsibility of his business, but the person who is working for some other company does not really feel the full responsibility.  If he does not feel the responsibility, the whole job becomes like a burden on him. There is little or no self-motivation. He keeps looking at his watch to see if it is time to leave! For him, only the first of every month is sweet, since it is payday!</p>\n<p>A sense of personal responsibility can help turn around any situation. A sense of personal responsibility can achieve great things. When you stand up with responsibility, you become a solid force. Until then, you remain a burden for yourself and for others.</p>\n<p>We often think that we are in an ordinary job. We wonder why we should take up more responsibility when our higher authorities at work are not doing so.</p>\n<p>Let me tell you, in an office, when a janitor does all his duties perfectly, he will inspire people. </p>\n<p>You see, the head of the organization has to be responsible. No credit is given to him for that! But someone in a lesser position demonstrating such responsibility is a true inspiration.</p>\n<p>There is a greater chance of people at a lower post inspiring others through their sense of responsibility than people at a higher level doing so. So don’t wait to get some authority to become responsible.</p>\n<p>Secondly, don’t think that you are in a lesser post, and therefore you need not be responsible. </p>\n<p>Thirdly, allow the cognitive shift to happen in you.</p>\n<p>It is said that when a person went to beg, He would appear like a king, and the people who gave Him alms would appear like beggars!</p>\n<p>Appearing like a beggar or a king is not because of your status or the property that you own. It is because of the state inside you.</p>\n<p>When you take up responsibility for the entire cosmos, you will expand and look like a leader, you will become a leader. Even if a leader sits on his throne and does not take responsibility, but instead points his finger at others for responsibility, he will appear small.</p>\n<p>The state is that which gets the status. The status can never get the state. <code class=\"language-text\">The state of Responsibilty is different from the status of Responsibility</code>.</p>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"When you take up responsibility, a cognitive shift happens in you.
