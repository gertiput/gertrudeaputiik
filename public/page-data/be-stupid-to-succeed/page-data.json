His reputation among the Moroccan internet pioneers has grown to set an example for many of them thanks to the advice and directions as well as the stimulus doses he provides to them in his videos spread on YouTube.</p>\n<p>One day, I went inside to watch one of these videos on YouTube, and I didn't know then that this view would change my way of thinking a lot.</p>\n<p>In that video, Simulayev said that he believed with certainty that idiots usually succeed more than smart people, for one reason is that most of the successful people were ready to repeat the same tasks daily without being tired or bored until they reach the results and goals they set at the beginning. This repetition and continuing to do the same thing and focus on it is not usually done by people who count themselves as smart, because they are always looking for shortcuts to achieve their goals, while the few who are successful fully realize that success is not an easy issue and only comes with work, hard work and patience.</p>\n<p>In fact, this idea or theory was not invented by Simulayev and not by him. Einstein said it decades ago when he denied himself the quality of supernatural intelligence and attributed his success and innovations to his permanent and continuous attempts to solve the problems facing him.</p>\n<p>Almost all geniuses and successful people have experienced persistence and perseverance, it is said that Thomas Edison made more than <code class=\"language-text\">1,000</code> failed <code class=\"language-text\">attempts</code> to make a light bulb before finally succeeding in his goal. There is an English wisdom tha says <code class=\"language-text\">repetition is the mother of learning</code> , so imagine with me if you intend to succeed as a blogger and start posting a blog every day or two, after a year you will have published at least 200 posts, and after two years you will reach 400 posts. Is not this large number of posts a guarantor By making your blog known and successful whatever the field in which you write?</p>\n<p>The problem facing most of those who did not succeed  is the rush to profit and expecting to harvest the fruits after the first or second attempt, this is nonsense! They count themselves smart, so they leave to find an easier way to make money. <code class=\"language-text\">There is no easy way to earn money! There is only work, fatigue, patience and results will come next</code>.</p>\n<p>Real intelligence is not the search for easy and short ways to achieve big goals, but intelligence is to draw goals and develop a realistic plan of action and perseverance on them without fatigue or boredom,  <code class=\"language-text\">even if this will make you appear in front of others stupid</code></p>","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"The title of this article may be surprising or even ridiculous, but I recommend that you do not rush to judge the issue before youâ€¦","frontmatter":{"title":"Be stupid to succeed","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":150,"height":150,"src":"/static/27fac3a95974ef772466e2e3785d23a5/44086/success.jpg","srcSet":"/static/27fac3a95974ef772466e2e3785d23a5/44086/success.jpg 1x,\n/static/27fac3a95974ef772466e2e3785d23a5/1caf6/success.jpg 1.5x"}}},"slug":"be-stupid-to-succeed","date":"2020-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["Code"],"tags":["life"],"template":"post"},"fields":{"slug":"/be-stupid-to-succeed/","date":"2020-01-13T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/be-stupid-to-succeed/"}}}
