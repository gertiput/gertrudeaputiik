tough type of friends that always support each other even amidst fighting. You can imagine being 4 friends in different age groups can cause a lot of fights growing up 😂</p>\n<p>I have my issues🤷‍♀️! I always wanted to prove myself &#x26; make my friends proud. A pressure that was just in my head; they were always proud of us. I wanted to grow up to be a pilot or an army officer. Let's just say I changed my mind!</p>\n<p>The literacy rate &#x26; level of #education in #Ghana is high, and like most cultures, most people end up following popular jobs &#x26; studies either as an #engineer, a #doctor (#physician) or as #officers. I wanted something different in #biology or #science!</p>\n<p>It is hard to keep up with society's #expectations &#x26; #judgement; I am sure most of you understand.\nNo matter what you do, someone is going to complain; shout out to my one friend for telling me this everytime 🙌 , so follow YOUR path!</p>\n<p>I went to the same JHS school for 10 yrs. It was excellent! It taught 4 languages: English(main) &#x26; Ga + French. My senior year, I chose Life&#x26;Earth Sciences (SVT) to do the gov. official exams to enter uni. That is how my journey began.</p>\n<p>After passing the official exams, the search started. Which undergrad scientific program should I take🤔? Back then, a new BSc in sciences was offered @ucc so after doing my research, I thought I'd dive in &#x26; take the risk💪😊</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, I am not an A+ student, on each exam, my brain goes through a nervous cycle by overthinking details ; I learned to channel it. What's the next step?</p>\n<p>Job opportunities &#x26; growth are difficult in #Ghana. You will be used, underpaid, unappreciated &#x26; unable to secure a stable future. I started looking for a way out but that is a challenge by itself. There are a lot of obstacles, especially financially, to overcome.</p>\n<p>In #Ghana, if you don't know the right people, you will not get really far. I got accepted into an architectural apprenticeship, a dream come true! I went to my friends, shared the news but for them I must have paid my way in so they didn't believe I got an apprenticeship. Haters gonna hate🤷‍♀️</p>\n<p>Started my apprenticeship, everything was going great, smoothly, experiments&#x26;results were ➕. I completed 90% of the project in the 1st 4 months ✔. My superior asked me if I'd like to fast track, I declined to apply for PR so instead they gave me the green light to start my own design works.</p>\n<p>Guess what happened during the following year?</p>\n<p>The Kraken was loose🌬️🌊!\nAnother student was a fav. in the company &#x26; I guess they didn't like the fact my projects was going well &#x26; theirs wasn't. They started spreading rumors to my superior so he treated me as if I was invisible...no guidance,no help, other priorities!</p>\n<p>I was stuck repeating 1 design for almost a 3 months because my results contradicted previous ones. In design meetings, my superior would skip over me or cut me short. </p>\n<p>I decided to send a first mini draft to my superior of the design intro; the feedback was bad (worse draft ever). I decided enough is enough! I took charge&#x26;with help from friends, I wrote the entire draft, demanded to be heard&#x26; had a design submission deadline</p>\n<p>It wasn't all bad. That year I started realizing maybe I didn't want to do a Architecture, maybe I should look for options, maybe I am good at something else. Many architects that I met were great&#x26;advised me to think it through. What were the options outside of Architecture?</p>\n<p>I am #sociable &#x26; I 💜 #science &#x26; #research. #Lost, I started applying to any #job outside #achitecture 😅..went to #interviews, felt great but never got the job(no #workexperience). I was reading #advice from #CareerCoaches &#x26; it hit me! My #apprenticeship was experience!</p>\n<p>After learning from my #interviews #mistakes &#x26; not giving up, I found a #job in #design. #Why? Because it has the #skills I wanted to land a #job in #architecture plus I needed it</p>\n<p>Overall I have being doing well! #Advancing on both #personal &#x26; #professional levels. I am always #challenging myself &#x26; trying to overcome the #challenges &#x26; #obstacles in my #path! Every year is better than the one before! </p>\n<p>I know how most #job #candidates feel! You #apply &#x26; apply...pass #interviews that went great but never get a #callback...you feel #down, #frustrated, #demotivated so it is #important to know you are #notalone, find your #niche, #support, #group </p>\n<p>If I had to offer one #advice, it's #Dontgiveup! It is #easier #said than #done I know😅 but what is the worse thing that could happen? #noreply #nocall, so what? You #learn from #Your #Mistakes, #Interviews, #peoplesadvice. Any #experience is #goodexperience!</p>\n<p>I wouldn't have made it to where I am #today without the #support &#x26; #love from my  #friends so #ThankYouAll! </p>","timeToRead":4,"excerpt":"Born & raised in #Accra #Ghana, a tiny country in the West Africa with a lot to offer.
