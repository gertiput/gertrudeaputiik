A lot of jobs require someone who can think on their feet or present ideas with crispness and clarity. This question provides employers with an early preview of your core skills, your personality and your ability to respond to an unstructured question.

## Q1. Tell me about yourself

**Sample answer**:

````
From a very early age I've been a problem solver. I was that kid who would take apart anything so I could see how it worked—and then try to put it back together.

As you can imagine, it drove my parents nuts. But even though I tortured my family at times, the tinkering trait has served me well in my career.

After graduating from [**school**], I was recruited into a [**job**] job and got paid to [**task**]. It was like living the dream.

That job also made me realize I'm really good with difficult customers, and that's what helped me land my [**current job**] role.

#### Why this answer worked well:
- He gave a vivid image of his childhood home and told a memorable story about it.
- He picked two prominent required skills from the job description, problem solving and customer service, and built this interesting narrative around it.
- He showed how his career successfully evolved before he was even asked about that.
````
This is something you'll be asked a lot at the beginning of an interview. Here are three tips that'll help you nail the opener.

**Be succinct, honest and engaging.**
I call this the “SHE” formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you're qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.

**Use the job description to prepare.**
Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they’re seeking.

**Tie your story to their needs.**
People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.

While I love my job and have been successful in it, it has moved me away from the manufacturing floor. Now, the reason I'm so interested in this position is that it seems to provide a really great blend of one-on-one work with clients and hands-on problem solving.

## Q2. What is your greatest strength?
Employers want to see if you can strike the right balance between confidence and humility. Hiring managers also want to get a sense for how self-aware and honest you are and align your strengths to the role at hand.

**Sample answer**:

```
What I bring to the team is a strong record in relationship building. 

I'm happiest when I'm engaging and strategizing about how we can help one another. I find that in sales, some people can be overly transactional. I think my superpower is in establishing more meaningful connections.

I've gotten strong feedback in the past. One client said I was the best business development person he'd ever met.

These types of connections have turned into big sales wins. For example, last year, I doubled my client base and outperformed my peers by 40%. And it's probably relevant to share that I started in that role without any contacts in the field.

```
Today, there isn't a Fortune 100 company that doesn't know about the product I sold last.

**Why this answer worked well:**
- She was specific and shared real numbers.
- She stayed relevant. The experience and the story all came together and she supported it all with numbers.

When responding to this question, you want to sound humble and not like you’re arrogant or bragging. Here are some tips to help you give them a great answer.

**Describe a relevant experience.**

If you're applying for a sales job, tell a story about a time where you helped a customer solve a problem with your solution.

**Give specific details.**

- Tell them about a time you closed a deal that helped you hit a percentage of your annual number. When you share those facts with them, it helps them visualise how effective you have been.

**Show them you’re a well-rounded person.**

- For example, share a story of when you used a “soft” skill, like effective communication with a coworker, and then one about you using a technical skill, which could be anything asked for in the job description.

## Q3. What is your greatest weakness?
The interviewer is assessing whether your weaknesses will get in the way of doing the job. Employers are looking for humility and whether you’re committed to learning and growing. This is a place you can showcase what you’re doing to improve.The interviewer is assessing whether your weaknesses will get in the way of doing the job. Employers are looking for humility and whether you’re committed to learning and growing. This is a place you can showcase what you’re doing to improve.

**Sample answer**:

```
I get excited when people on my team brainstorm about big new ideas. I sometimes get so caught up in the moment that I volunteer to do too much. I know this can be a distraction in ways that put me at risk of not getting work done properly or missing deadlines.

I've been reflecting on why this happens. As I've become more conscious of this pattern, I'm working on ways to contain the negative aspects of my eagerness.

One way that I do this is to still go to brainstorming meetings but to be more careful about offering to do the next steps—or limit it to one project that my boss supports.

Fortunately, though, the job we're discussing seems well-suited for people like me, people that bring a lot of enthusiasm to the job and are ready to keep getting better and better at the follow-through.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**
- He shared a story about how a weakness would negatively impact his work and stress him out.
- He turned his self-awareness into a plan to help him manage that weakness so he would be successful in the future.
- He shared specific details, which made the story feel relatable.

This can feel like a tricky question, but it’s a good opportunity to shine. Here are some tips on how to answer:

**Be humble**
You want to communicate an authentic story that shows you're self-aware. It's okay that you don't come off as perfect, that's authentic, which is important for someone who will have to trust you in the role that they're hiring for.

**Choose a trait that is not too relevant to the job.**
For example, if you're applying for a project manager role, choose a weakness that is more related to creativity, which is something that doesn't disqualify you from the description of the things that would make someone successful in that role.

**Show how you manage it.**
Have a fix-it strategy. For example, if you struggle with remembering product details so you track them in their phone or side notebook, that's okay, share that with them. That shows that you've got commitment to solving that problem and addressing it.

## Q4. Why should we hire you?

This question tests how persuasive you are. Interviewers want to see if you can make a calm, confident case for yourself, even if they’re acting skeptical. They’re looking for factual and compelling answers.

**Sample answer**

```
I've got both the experience and target audience rapport that you're looking for.

I've built two corporate training programs from scratch and developed the kind of interactive video programs that you're looking to create.

When employees fill out feedback forms, they speak highly of my professionalism and clarity that they've encountered.

Here’s a quick example.

A close friend of mine on your marketing team says that this company is a great cultural fit given my background and values. I have an insatiable level of curiosity and tend to do lots of research on any topic that I'm less than an expert in. And I know your values include constant learning. That really resonates with my passion.

I'm just eager to become part of a fast-growing, mission-oriented organization like yours.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**

- He spoke about his core strengths in a way that related to the job requirements.
- He used favorable feedback from some of his previous coworkers, and their positive observations were helpful.
- He talked about why he was a good cultural fit for the organization.

This is a nerve-racking question, so make sure you're set up for success. Here are some tips that can help you do well in answering it:

**Ask yourself why you think you’re qualified.**

Prepare for the interview by picking three or four qualifications and experiences that help them understand why you're a fit for this job.

**Tell them how you’d fit in.**

Paint a picture of what you’d accomplish that gives you a leg up on the competition. Also, show them why you are a great match for this company by letting them see that you know about their mission, their vision, how they operate—and how you would fit into that really well.

**Speak authentically.**
How you say something is as important as what you say. So when you're sharing your successes and you're answering these questions, speak like the best version of yourself and make sure that you're doing it in a way that allows the interviewers to connect to you.

## Q5. Why do you want to work here?

Interviewers want to understand what prompted you to apply for this job. They don’t want candidates who are indifferent to where they work. Instead, they want someone who offers very specific reasons for why they want this job.

**Sample answer**

```
he first thing that prompted me to apply is your commitment to service. I've been a customer for five years since I first bought a house. We had a big storm that damaged my roof last year, and I was impressed by how caring and prompt your customer service representatives were as I worked through it.

I'm also excited about your upcoming merger. I can see how this is going to set you apart in the insurance industry. I'd love to help you through the process of integrating the two companies. Having supported a merger three years ago, I know what an intricate and stressful process that can be. I have a few specific ideas on how I might ease the transition.

Lastly, I applied because I see this as an opportunity for me to broaden my financial services experience. This seems to be a natural fit based on my understanding of regulated industries.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**

- He has done his homework and sees an opportunity to help this company through a challenging and exciting transition.
- He made it about them first and then wove in some of his own personal career goals.

You would be amazed by how few people get this question right. So you've got a big opportunity to shine.

**Make it all about them.**

Your best answer will be about what they need. It'll show that you've done your research and have thought through what you can contribute to that team.

**Show them how you can help.**

Weave your story into the context of what you can contribute. If you have strong accounting skills and are interviewing for a finance role at a humane society, you could suggest that this job would allow you to blend your professional skills with your passion for animals.

**Speak from the heart.**

Telling a genuine story can make a big difference. For example, I once worked with a client who was applying for a zoo event manager job and she had grown up next door to that zoo and had great memories of the peacocks flying over the fence and sitting on her dad's car. So her answer was that she wanted people to have fun memories of that zoo just like she did. Try to top that.

## Q6. Tell me about a time you showed leadership.

Employers want to understand your capacity to step up and handle tough situations that undoubtedly arise in the workplace. They want to know when you’ve seen an opening to lean in and lead with good judgment.

**Sample answer**

```
Recently there was a situation where my manager needed to take medical leave and was unable to come into work for a few weeks. This coincided with a major deadline that he was leading. I knew that if this project wasn't completed on time, we were at risk of losing a major client.

I looked to my right and my left, and there wasn't anyone else who could own the project, so I jumped in with both feet and took the initiative.

I went through the files and developed a schedule detailing what needed to be completed, and I worked with my coworkers to ensure they were on board too.

I went through the files and developed a schedule detailing what needed to be completed, and I worked with my coworkers to ensure they were on board too.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**

- She shared details that make it easy to visualize what was happening.
- She described how she got her coworkers onboard and met the deadline to keep her loyal client.

Respond to this kind of question with a compelling story that uses the "SAR" framework: situation, action, and results.

**Describe the situation.**

Talk about the initial events that occurred. What were the problems that you were experiencing? What needed to be solved and what resources did you have--or not have? This is a really key part of the story, so it should be about three to four sentences long.

**Get into the action.**

Speak about the key milestones that you went through. Tell them what you did to turn the situation around. Don't go into too much detail though. It should only be about two to three sentences, and try to use active verbs, things like “I implemented” or “I persuaded”.

**Show the results.**

Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way. Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing.

## Q7. Tell me about a time you were successful on a team.

If you can show that you’ve helped a team move through a challenge, you probably have strong communication and interpersonal skills. These kinds of “soft” skills are in high demand and make people successful in their jobs.

**Sample answer**

```
I was asked to work on a high-profile project that included collaborating with a new team and tons of people across a larger organization.

We were spread out across the globe, which meant timezones were tricky and we could never meet face-to-face. Communication was starting to get confusing, and people were losing important details.

It became apparent that this project was going to fail if we didn’t have a new strategy, so I met with various team members and engaged them in a process where we designed and implemented a communication system that would work a lot better.

We then did weekly check-ins; designed a protocol to share relevant updates so we’d stay on track; developed a detailed outline of goals and milestones; and led the meetings.

In the end, the team made massive progress. We completed the project on time, and it was praised extensively by the client. The team thanked me for helping to course-correct. We also continue to use these tools, and they are what make our team so much more efficient at what we do.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**

- She started off discussing a specific situation and the issues involved with having to work on a global team.
- She talked about the specific action steps she took like implementing a new work process.
- She described the positive results and teamwork skills she demonstrated along the way.

## Q8. What would your co-workers say about you?

Interviewers want to know if you’ll fit in with the team. This question can also help you highlight your strengths without feeling like you’re bragging.

```
I think my coworkers would tell you that I'm the one you turn to when it's time to make sure everyone stays motivated and on track to pull off big, high-profile projects.

In one of my Vinsys recommendations, my supervisor refers to me as the “Human Glue”, which is something I'm proud of. She gave me that nickname after we went through a complex ERP implementation. It was one of those stressful time-critical projects that required the team to come together and make things happen in a short amount of time.

I kept the crew going, sometimes through long evening and weekend hours, and inspired them to bring their absolute best to the project everyday.

I think that they also appreciated the pizza and donuts I brought in too.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**

- He shared something specifically related to the job.
- He pointed the interviewer to a supervisor's favorable LinkedIn recommendation.
- He shared a bit of humor.

This question gives you an opportunity to share how amazing you are—without feeling like you're showboating. Here are three quick tips on how to answer it:

**Find features that fit.**
Re-read the job description and look for answers that go well with it. For example, if they need a strong problem solver, maybe you can share that your office nickname is “The Fixer” because you're so good at solving tough challenges.

**Share some of your reviews.**
Before the interview, go through your LinkedIn recommendations and performance reviews and see if there are some gold nuggets you might want to show them. And if it's on LinkedIn, mention it to the interviewers so they can read the whole recommendation if they want more detail.

**Back it up with evidence.**
If you think your colleagues would say that you're super creative, resist the urge to say “People like that I can think outside of the box”. Instead, share a tangible example of your creativity that ties to the job description.

## Q9. Why do you want to leave your current role?

Employers say they want to hire people who are running “to” a role as opposed to running “away.” However, they are also interested in your honesty when things haven’t worked out and will give people second chances when they demonstrate hunger.

**Sample answer**

```
I'm eager to find a new opportunity and grow.

As you can see, I've been doing the same kind of work for two and a half years, and I'm starting to stagnate. My company doesn't have a role open for the next step up, unfortunately. So, I'm excited about the opportunity of becoming a sales manager at your company.

The new role will let me use the skills I've developed in my current role like making cold calls; hooking in new clients with pithy-but-inspiring opening lines; following up with carefully crafted emails; listening to their pain points; and then offering up solutions that can solve their problems.

I'm eager to make a fresh start, and I want to use my cold calling and listening skills to help craft an even better solution with the product I'd be working on in this new role.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**

- She was positive and talked about her excitement about the new role. She did say she started to stagnate in her current role though, so she should tweak that language a bit to make it more favorable to them.
- She talked about using her current skills to gain new skills and experiences as a sales manager.
- She framed this in the context of the new role and the new job she's applying for. She should make it even more about how excited she is about the products—and selling them—for the company she's applying to.

Hiring managers will often ask this question, and it's a test. Are you running away from something, or are you running towards something? The advice when you get this question is simple:

**Stay positive.**
Employers want to see that you have a good attitude in general. Resist the temptation to say bad things about your current job, employer, or boss.

**Focus on where you’d like to go.**
You should come off as someone who is looking forward, not backward. Portray your interests more in the light of what you want to get out of your next role.

**Bring it back to them.**
Show them that you’ve done your homework about their company, and relate what you tell them back to the specific job you're interviewing for.

## Q10. Describe your most challenging project.

Employers want to get a sense of what ‘challenging’ means to you. They also want to know how you handled the situation in a calm way. They’re looking for a storyline to prove that you can turn a bad story into a good story.

**Sample answer**

```
In my current role, I was in charge of leading a major marketing campaign for a new product launching nationwide.

The project was challenging both because of how large it was and because it involved constant communication with at least seven teams inside my company. Even though I tried to share the same information with everyone, it was clear that not everyone was on the same page.

Partway through, I discovered that some of the teams were not on schedule with their assigned tasks. The implications were significant, and a delay to the campaign would negatively impact our revenue goals.

I identified the root causes of the delays and set up a plan of action to address them. I planned in-depth one-on-one meetings with the team leaders to help re-inspire them. We talked about the goals and set ambitious targets for getting these last items across the finish line. I then organized and led status-update calls for the larger team and implemented a public dashboard to keep everyone accountable.

In the end, we did meet the marketing campaign deadlines and the product launch was a hit. The company hit their revenue goals and everyone on the sales team received a well-deserved bonus.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**

- She told us about the potential for serious negative consequences.
- She described concrete action steps she took to overcome this challenge.
- She shared the positive results of her actions.

**Show the results.**

Let them know how well things turned out, how the problems were solved and what you may have learned along the way. Try to include a clincher at the end, like dollars saved or improved profitability. It drives home that you did a great thing.

## Q10. Tell me about something you’ve accomplished that you are proud of.

This question assesses how you define a professional success. If the story resonates, the employer will want you to do similar things at his or her company. You should focus on the impact and outcomes.

**Sample answer**

```
When I first joined the company, I noticed that the existing monthly budgeting process was quite time-consuming and inefficient because it was highly manual.

There were errors and inaccuracies, and I took the initiative to implement a new budgeting template to automate the process and make it simpler.

I developed automated calculations using Excel and fill-in-the-blank lines for departments to submit their numbers. Then I designed and led a training for all relevant staff. The new system made it easier for the departments to provide their budgets in an error-free way.

Overall, we had 25% fewer errors in the next cycle of budgets and my team became 30% more efficient. My manager gave me a very strong review for the quarter and noted that she appreciated my initiative to automate and make the process a lot less cumbersome.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**

- She started off by discussing the situation she inherited when she joined the company.
- She described the action steps she took to improve the situation.
- She quantified the positive results and relayed how impactful this was for her and her team.

## Q11. Can you explain your employment gap?

This question isn’t designed to rule you out - it’s a good sign if you get the interview. Interviewers want to get more context about the gap and whether you’re still going to be a great fit for the role, despite the gap.

**Sample answer**

```
Yes, so a few years ago I was working in Seattle as a global finance manager. I loved my job and got to travel all over the world.

My dad, who lives in Michigan, was diagnosed with dementia that same year, and my mom was having a hard time giving him the level of care he needed. I decided to put my career on pause and go help them.

I not only got to spend quality time with my parents and sister, but I was able to get their finances in order so that when it was time for him to enter a care home, they were in a great spot to afford it.

He's doing really well at the facility, so now I can refocus on my career.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**

- He told the truth; he left work to care for a family member.
- He delivered it with confidence and was unapologetic about the gap.
- He showcased the positive by explaining his action plan to keep his finance skills sharp.

Most people are nervous about how a gap will be perceived—even if there's a good explanation, But if they’ve invited you in for an interview, then the gap hasn’t ruled you out. Here are some tips on how to discuss it:

**Be honest.**
The truth will set you free. Try to put the situation into the best light and don't lie; it's bound to come back and haunt you. So if your job was eliminated through a merger, just say so.

**Speak with confidence.**
For example, if you had taken some time away from working, avoid acting like you're embarrassed, apologetic or ashamed. The interviewer is going to pick up on that. Instead, pause and you see how they respond. The more calm, succinct and confident you are, the more at ease the interviewer will be with your answer—and with you.

**Show the benefits of your time off.**
Bring up the good that came out of that time whether you were laid off, stepped away to be with family, or even got fired. It's a great way to reframe the situation and an opportunity to showcase some useful skills that you gained during that time.

## Q12. What are your salary expectations?

If this question arises early, odds are that the interviewer is really asking: “Can we afford you?” If it arises much later, the interviewer may be hoping that your salary requirements are aligned to what they have budgeted for this role.

**Sample answer**

```
I've been doing some research on the market for the role of Sales Analyst.

What I found from LinkedIn's salary tool is that here in Chicago, base pay for these jobs tends to run between $61,000 and $71,000. Half the companies pay bonuses as well.

Given the global impact of your company, and the fact that candidates with Master's degrees, like me, are being recruited most heavily, I think we should be looking toward the top end of that range.

```

**Why this answer worked well:**

- She started off by giving a salary range instead of a specific number.
- She brought neutral research to the table, which establishes her as someone who's trustworthy, bold and grounded.
- She did a credible job of showing why she should be at that higher range, which made her come across as confident and steady.

This is a question you'll get all too often, so here are a few tips to help you master the answer:

**Give them a salary range.**
Let them know there’s room to negotiate (instead of starting with a specific number). Avoid going too low though, because that's going to work against your interests. And don’t go too high either, or you may freeze yourself out of the opportunity.

**Do some neutral research.**
Give them a reasonable place to start from. You can use a resource like the LinkedIn Salary Tool to find out what other companies are paying people in this role and share with them what you learned about this salary range. Then they’ll have to base their compensation at least on those numbers because you've let them know what other similar organizations are giving to employees who do that job.

**Bring up signing bonuses.**
Doing this can create a win-win situation for both parties. At the end of a negotiation, asking for extra money up top is often a way to bridge the gap between what you want and what you’re being offered.
