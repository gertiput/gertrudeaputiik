Happiness is a range of feelings from positive emotions to great joy.

Happiness changes the way we see ourselves and situations. Our happiness affects how we react in situations and interact with others.

#Happiness is a choice.

#Happiness is infectious.

Researchers have found that happiness supports: a stronger immune system, stronger resilience in the face of stress, a stronger heart and less risk of cardiovascular disease, alongside quicker recovery times when overcoming illness or surgery.

Happiness maximises our ability to look after ourselves. Happiness supports more exercise, better socializing, healthy eating, good sleep hygiene.

And you might think that happiness comes from money, status, power.

Well...think again.... 

Happiness is a deep emotion...usually originating from:

1) deep satisfaction in ourselves
2) sharing life with other happy individuals
3) good #values.
